## Camera Options


You can select a camera mode that ensures the best view for your meeting and device. The camera can switch from one speaker to the next, automatically adjust so that you are always centered, group participants together, or you can choose to adjust it manually. 

By selecting an automatic camera mode you'll get the best view for your device and meeting, without having to manually control the cameras yourself during meetings. You can change camera modes whether you're in a call or not. 

Depending on the device you're using, there are a few different modes to choose from:


* Group: The camera will adjust to show everyone. 
* Frames: The camera will zoom and show people individually or in smaller groups. 
*	Speaker: The camera will follow the person speaking. The maximum distance for speaker tracking to work is 7.5 meters. 
*	Best view: The camera will adjust automatically so you are always in the center of the frame. 
*	Manual: Adjust the camera yourself. 

1.	Swipe right on the home screen. Tap **Camera**. 
2.	If the camera modes are not visible, Tap **camera mode** and then **Auto**. 
3.	Choose a mode. On Board Pro, you can choose between Group, Frames, or Speaker.
4.	You can also tap **Manual** and adjust the camera yourself.


Note: You can also access and adjust the camera controls in or out of call by tapping the camera button on your self-view.
