# Cisco Camera Modes in MTR UI and Microsoft IntelliFrame 

You can now select your preferred camera mode directly from the Microsoft Teams app on Cisco devices. 
This update brings the familiar Cisco camera experiences into Microsoft Teams, using Microsoft’s naming conventions for seamless 
integration. Additionally, Microsoft Cloud IntelliFrame, a cloud-based video intelligence feature, is now available.

## New Camera Mode Menu Options

The following camera modes are available in the Microsoft Teams UI on Cisco devices:

   * IntelliFrame: Microsoft’s cloud-based smart video feeds zoom into the faces of in-room participants, minimizing distractions.
   * Room: Displays a view of the entire room, powered by Cisco’s Group framing technology.
   * Active Speaker: Uses Cisco’s on-device speaker tracking technology to focus on the active speaker in the room.
   * Composite: Employs Cisco’s AI-powered Frames technology to zoom, crop, and frame individuals and groups in a single view,
     eliminating unused space while preserving meeting context.
