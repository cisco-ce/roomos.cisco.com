# Get started with administering Cisco devices in Control Hub

When you register your devices to [Control Hub](https://help.webex.com/nkhozs6/), you get access to centralized device management. With Control Hub registered devices, users can join [Webex Meetings](https://roomos.cisco.com/doc/MTR/WebexMeetings) with an extensive range of built-in features.

Contact your parter to set up Control Hub access for your organization.

## Managing and supporting your device deployment

You can achieve scalable and efficient deployments with Control Hub. Control Hub offers comprehensive device and workspace management: 

* Status monitoring
* Detailed device and workspace history
* Workspace overviews
* Real-time alerts
* Configuration access

Learn the basics of managing [workspaces](https://help.webex.com/noolw6w/) in Control Hub.

You can [search, list, and show status values](https://help.webex.com/nvdtsac/) from a specific device directly on Control Hub. A status contains the current state of the device, such as connected calls, connected inputs, and output sources.

[Device history](https://help.webex.com/jhkg7ab/) allows you to quickly check what has happened on the device. Details on changes to configurations, macros, web apps, and software versions help you when you want to see what has been changed and when you have to troubleshoot a device.

Get an [overview of all your workspaces](https://help.webex.com/yuzsuw/) within your organization, know the state-of-affairs, and make data-driven decisions about your workplace resources.

Keep up to date with your devices by setting up alerts. With [device alerts](https://help.webex.com/u3uiam/), you can view all important events and updates in one place.

Apply [settings and configurations](https://help.webex.com/n5pqqcm/) to your devices, individually or for the whole organization.

### Run commands right from the cloud

Easily control devices with commands and keep track of changes through device history.

[Commands](https://help.webex.com/9lk0bf/) instruct a device to execute actions, such as to go into standby mode or to set a new user passphrase.

[Device history](https://help.webex.com/jhkg7ab/) allows you to quickly check what has happened on the device. Details on changes to configurations, macros, web apps, and software versions help you when you want to see what has been changed and when you have to troubleshoot a device.

## Proactively monitor usage and meeting room environment

Gaining insights into how your organization's devices and workspaces are used can lead to better decision-making. By understanding usage patterns and environmental conditions, you can allocate resources more efficiently and improve operational effectiveness. This results in a smarter use of space and technology, optimizing overall performance.

## Customize your in room experience 

Enhance your workspace capabilities with custom controls, workspace integrations, and automated alerts.

Create custom controls for your users with [UI extensions and macros](https://help.webex.com/gj962f/).

[Workspace integrations](https://developer.webex.com/docs/workspace-integrations) provide a framework for services to access Webex developer APIs, with a focus on extending the capabilities of workspaces and Cisco devices.

You can [set up a webhook callback URL](https://help.webex.com/3gv4ci/) so that alerts show up in third-party applications. Control Hub offers an alerts center which allows you to create, manage, and receive alerts on various events across your deployment through multiple delivery channels. The delivery channels that alert center currently support are through email, Webex App spaces, and in Control Hub.

[Webhooks for room analytics](https://help.webex.com/nj9r68z/) are a powerful way to automate monitoring of devices. You can allow Control Hub to send requests to a specified web service containing information about an event that happened on a device. For example, when the people count value changes. The service can then act based on the incoming webhook, for example store the data, or trigger other events or services.

The Board, Desk, and Room Series devices feature [User interface (UI) extensions](https://roomos.cisco.com/doc/TechDocs/UiExtensions) that enable you to design new panels and action buttons for creating custom functionalities.

You can enable [web views](https://roomos.cisco.com/doc/MTR/WebViews) to display web content. This allows users to interact with web applications or content directly from the interface of the Cisco device. 

Track and Analyze usage and environmental performance of your device deployment using [comprehensive reports and historical data insights](https://help.webex.com/n0rlwxe/#reference-template_08600d25-d4ad-4016-af4f-37c4a8b98c23
