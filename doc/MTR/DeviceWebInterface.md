# The device web interface

A Cisco collaboration device comes with a web interface, which is an administration portal for the device. You can connect from a computer and administer the device remotely. It provides full configuration access and offers tools and mechanisms for maintenance.

## Requirements and limitations 

The device web interface requires that HTTP or HTTPS is enabled (refer to the _NetworkServices > HTTP > Mode_ setting).

## Sign in and open the device web interface

Find the device’s IP address:

1.	Tap More on the device’s home screen.
2.	Tap Settings, followed by Device settings.
3.	Tap About this room device to find the IP address.

Sign in and open the web interface:
1.	Open a web browser and enter the device’s IP address in the address bar.  
We recommend that you use the latest release of one of the major web browsers (Internet Explorer is not supported). 
3.	Enter username and passphrase for the device and click Sign In.  
The device is delivered with a default user named admin. A passphrase is assigned when onboarding the device to MTR.
