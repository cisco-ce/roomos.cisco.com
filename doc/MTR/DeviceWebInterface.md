# The device web interface

A Cisco collaboration device comes with a web interface, which is an administration portal for the device. You can connect from a computer and administer the device remotely. It provides full configuration access and offers tools and mechanisms for maintenance.

## Requirements and limitations 

The device web interface requires that HTTP or HTTPS is enabled (refer to the _NetworkServices > HTTP > Mode_ setting).
