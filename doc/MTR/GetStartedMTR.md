# Getting started with MTR
## The home screen
The home screen is the starting point from where you'll access all the features and functionality your device has to offer. Tap the device's screen to wake it up and see the home screen. Your device's name is in the upper left corner, along with the time. On the side you'll see a panel with your upcoming meetings, if any are scheduled.

There are four buttons on the home screen. Tap them to:

* **Meet now**. Find a contact in your directory and start a call.
* **Whiteboard**. Open the Microsoft whiteboard and get creative.
* **Share**. Start sharing content.
* **More**. Access the volume controls and device **Settings** menu.

## The control panel

Swipe from the right side of your screen to open the control panel. You can access the control panel whether you're in a call or not. If you're in a call, the panel opens on top of the call and you can check or change settings without interrupting anything.

In the control panel you can access and adjust settings that you use on a regular basis, like:

* **Camera**. Choose a camera mode, including the option to manually adjust the camera to suit your meeting.
* **Selfview**. As long as your camera is open/on, you'll see your selfview at the top of the control panel. Here you'll find the options to show or hide the selfview in and out of calls. 
* **Background**. Select a virtual background to show behind you during calls. 
* **Fullscreen**. Tap to show your selfview in full screen. To close it swipe right and tap the **Fullscreen** button again. While you're in full screen mode you get a **Camera** button and a **Background** button on the edge of the screen and can adjust your outgoing view with those. 
* **Select share source**. Choose a sharing source when you've got more than one connected, and start sharing content, in or out of a call.
* **Microphone**. Choose noise removal or optimize the microphone for your voice.
* **Standby**. Put the device into standby mode.
* **Auto brightness**. Manually adjust screen brightness or let the device adjust itself automatically.
* **Speakers**. Adjust speaker volume. You can also adjust volume by tapping **More** on the home screen to get the same controls there.

Tapping one of these buttons opens the relevant settings inside the control panel, and you can make your adjustments. Then tap anywhere else inside the control panel to close the settings and return to the main panel. Tap anywhere outside the control panel to close it and return to the home screen.
