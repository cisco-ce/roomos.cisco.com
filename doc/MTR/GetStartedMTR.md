# Getting started on a Cisco device with Microsoft Teams Rooms
## The home screen
The home screen is the starting point from where you'll access all the features and functionality your device has to offer. Tap the device's screen to wake it up and see the home screen, or tap the connected Room Navigator. Your device's name is in the upper left corner, along with the time. On the side you'll see a panel with your upcoming meetings, if any are scheduled.

There are three or four buttons on the home screen, depending on the device. Tap them to:

* **Meet now**. Find a contact in your directory and start a call.
* **Whiteboard**. Open the Microsoft whiteboard and get creative. (Board Pro and Desk Pro)
* **Share**. Start sharing content.
* **More**. Access the volume controls and device **Settings** menu.

## The control panel

Swipe from the right side of your screen or on the Room Navigator to open the control panel. You can access the control panel whether you're in a call or not. If you're in a call, the panel opens on top of the call and you can check or change settings without interrupting anything.

In the control panel you can access and adjust settings that you use on a regular basis, like:

* **Camera**. Choose a camera mode, including the option to manually adjust the camera to suit your meeting. Read more about [camera settings](https://roomos.cisco.com/doc/MTR/CameraOptions).
* **Selfview**. As long as your camera is open/on, you'll see your selfview at the top of the control panel. Here you'll find the options to show or hide the selfview in and out of calls. 
* **Background**. Select a virtual background to show behind you during calls. (Desk Pro)
* **Fullscreen**. Tap to show your selfview in full screen. To close it swipe right and tap the **Fullscreen** button again. While you're in full screen mode you get a **Camera** button and a **Background** button on the edge of the screen and can adjust your outgoing view with those. 
* **Select share source**. Choose a sharing source when you've got more than one connected, and start sharing content, in or out of a call.
* **Microphone**. Choose noise removal or optimize the microphone for your voice. Read more about [microphone options](https://roomos.cisco.com/doc/MTR/MicrophoneOptions).
* **Standby**. Put the device into standby mode.
* **Auto brightness**. Manually adjust screen brightness or let the device adjust itself automatically.
* **Speakers**. Adjust speaker volume. You can also adjust volume by tapping **More** on the home screen to get the same controls there.

Tapping one of these buttons opens the relevant settings inside the control panel, and you can make your adjustments. Then tap anywhere else inside the control panel to close the settings and return to the main panel. Tap anywhere outside the control panel to close it and return to the home screen. 

## Content sharing

You can share content from your computer with other participants during calls or meetings. When you aren’t in a call, connect your computer to use the device as an extension for your laptop screen.  

Connect your computer to the device with a USB-C or HDMI cable.

1. Tap the **Share** button on the home screen and your laptop screen immediately appears full screen on the device.   
2. If you have both an HDMI and a USB-C source connected, swipe right to open the control panel and tap **Select share source** to switch sources. Otherwise, the source you connected last is the one shared by default.

4. Tap **Stop sharing** to end the share.  

   Or, tap **Exit full screen** to return to the home screen view with your computer screen minimized in the bottom left corner. Tap the minimized screen to open it in full again, or tap **Stop sharing** on the home screen to close it completely.   


## The Settings menu

You can check device information, issues and diagnostics, network settings, and change settings in the device **Settings** menu. The menu is available both in and out of call, and the availability of various settings might be restricted by your administrator.

To open the **Settings** menu, tap the **More** button on the home screen. Tap **Settings**, and then tap **Device settings** in the dialog that opens after that.

*NOTE:* before you open the **Settings** menu, there are options available to **Report an issue** or view information **About** the device.

Tap any entry in the menu to check or change a setting (as long as you have access to it). Tapping the back arrow in the upper right corner returns you to the main menu. Settings with a lock symbol next to them require an admin username and passphrase to access.

*NOTE:* **Factory reset** is available from the **Settings** menu. Selecting to factory reset returns your device to default settings and you’ll lose your current registration. Factory resetting is irreversible.  

## Accessibility

Tailor your device’s screen to best suit your needs, with the *Accessibility* settings:  

1. Tap **More** on the home screen. Tap **Settings**, and then **Device settings**.  
2. Scroll to and select **Accessibility**.  
3. Select and change settings as needed:

* **Text size**. Small, normal, large, extra large.
* **Color correction**. Toggle it on or off and correct.
* **Screen Reader**. Toggle it on or off. When the feature is on, you can tap on any text on the screen to have it read out loud. If you select a graphical user interface (GUI) item, such as a checkbox, it will first read out the option, and then you need to double-tap it to perform the action, like checking the box.
* **High contrast**. Toggle it on or off.
