#Cisco collaboration MTR devices

Cisco collaboration devices offer camera and audio intelligence, and rich content sharing for Microsoft Teams meetings. You also get the option to enjoy full-featured Webex meetings in Microsoft Teams Rooms mode with no reconfiguration required, combined with advanced device management, remote monitoring, and workspace analytics capabilities. 



Designed for multi-platform collaboration, Cisco devices have RoomOS as an underlying layer where MTR runs on top of that as a contained Android-based application. Cisco devices help organizations to provide a consistent user experience with Microsoft Teams Rooms for every workspace, from personal desks and huddle spaces to very large rooms and specialist AV scenarios.

Cisco devices feature AI-powered in-call experiences including noise removal and camera intelligence capabilities built-into our hardware solutions, resulting in a high-quality, inclusive, distraction free meeting experience on any platform. Users can easily access camera and audio settings at any time – both in and out of call.

##Expand your device’s capabilities 

Cisco MTR enables customers to register their devices in Control Hub for advanced cloud management, diagnostics, and analytics. This way admins can take advantage of RoomOS APIs to integrate with 3rd party room systems and controllers, enable customizations, get Webex meetings diagnostics, leverage network-level diagnostics and observability (coming soon), and make informed decisions about workspace investments with room environmental and utilization data originating from device sensors (even outside of a video meeting).
