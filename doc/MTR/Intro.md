Cisco devices feature AI-powered in-call experiences including noise removal and camera intelligence capabilities built-into our hardware solutions, resulting in a high-quality, inclusive, distraction free meeting experience on any platform. Users can easily access camera and audio settings at any time – both in and out of call. 

## Expand your device’s capabilities 

Cisco enables customers to register their Microsoft Teams Rooms certified devices in Control Hub for advanced cloud management, diagnostics, and analytics. This way admins can take advantage of RoomOS APIs to integrate with 3rd party room systems and controllers, get Webex meetings diagnostics, and leverage network-level diagnostics. These capabilities let you make informed decisions about workspace investments with room environmental and utilization data originating from device sensors.  

With [Control Hub registration](/doc/MTR/ControlHubRegistration), you also get the option to join full-featured Webex meetings in Microsoft Teams Rooms mode with no reconfiguration required, combined with advanced device management, remote monitoring, and workspace analytics capabilities.
