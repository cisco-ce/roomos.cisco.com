### Enabling Zoom and Calling Services

In order to join Zoom meetings, you need to **Enable Zoom** in Control Hub. Read [here](https://help.webex.com/en-us/article/zai3j4/Enable-join-Zoom-meetings-on-Board,-Desk,-and-Room-Series) to follow the steps.

If your calling services are set to **None**, the calling options may appear greyed out. However, you can still use certain features:

* Calling to Webex will work even if the options are greyed out.
* Calling to Zoom will not work because you won't be able to connect through the required gateway (L2SIP GW) unless calling in Webex is enabled.

To use full calling functionality, ensure that calling services are enabled in your Control Hub Settings.
