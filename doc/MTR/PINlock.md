# Secure your device with a PIN lock


Add an extra layer of privacy to the device with a 6-digit PIN lock, keeping your data safe and notifications discreet.

**Note**: This Feature requires MTR device to be managed in Webex Control Hub. Read [this article](https://help.webex.com/en-us/article/7y056e/Secure-your-Board,-Desk,-or-Room-Series-device-with-a-PIN-lock#sx10_r_first-time-pin-for-personal-mode) to learn how to set up the PIN on personal and shared devices.

With a personal 6-digit PIN on your device, you can keep your private information safe. When your device is locked, sensitive data like calendars, call records, and whiteboards are inaccessible. Important notifications continue to reach you without revealing details, and emergency calling remains functional. Upcoming meeting alerts are only seen if the device is configured with Webex Hybrid calendar.

If configured, emergency calling is available even in locked state.
