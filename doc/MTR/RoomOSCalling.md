Dial the video address in one of the following formats:

* <meeting_number>@webex.com for a scheduled Webex meeting

* <Personal_Room_ID>.<site_name>@webex.com for an instant or scheduled Webex Personal Room meeting
  
* IP address for an instant or scheduled Webex Personal Room meeting or a scheduled Webex meeting. Enter the meeting number when prompted.
