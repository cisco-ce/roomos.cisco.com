# Software upgrades

Cisco collaboration devices with Microsoft Teams Rooms get upgraded automatically from Teams Admin Center. The upgrade cadence from Microsoft is different from RoomOS from Cisco and upgrades happen approximately every three months.

For Cisco collaboration devices with Microsoft Teams Rooms and Control Hub, you can choose either Cisco or Microsoft as the software provider. You also get the option to use [advanced software upgrades](https://help.webex.com/idba5c/#Cisco_Reference.dita_7275e9c5-314e-4fb3-92d5-a2c40c47ffb0).

With Cisco as the software provider, you can choose from the following channels:

* **Stable:** Default option. The latest Stable release of RoomOS that contains software fixes and new features.
  * Software update typically once a month
* **Microsoft approved:** Provides the same software version that is available through Teams Admin Center. Supported by Microsoft.
* **Preview:** Preview of the upcoming stable release that contains fixes to the software, but no new features.
  *	Software update typically once a month.
* **Verification:** Can be used to verify a new release before deploying it. 
  *	Available when advanced software control is enabled.
* **Trial:** An additional channel that gives you more flexibility when managing the software on your deployment. It can be used as an additional testing channel or for example home office devices or complex meeting rooms.
  *	Available when advanced software control is enabled.

With Microsoft as the software provider there is no channel selection in Control Hub, as software is managed through Teams Admin Center
