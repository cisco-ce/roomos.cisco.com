# Sample heading for document

The # symbol followed by a space is used for main article heading.

It's the same markdown as used in the **Webex App**. Use ** around a word for **bold**, and single * around a word for *italic*.

## Sections

Use ## for sub heading / sections. Sub headings will appear in the quick jump table of contents on the right side.

Parapraphs appear when you have an empty line between text.

## Second sub heading here

Make unordered lists with *, folled by a space.

* Bullet point 1
* Bullet point 2
* Bullet point 3

Numbered lists can be made with numbers and a dot, followed by space.

1. First point
2. Second point
3. Third point

## Images and links

Images should first be uploaded to the /doc/images/mtr folder. Then they can be addressed like this:

```
<img src="/doc/images/MTR/myimage.png" />
```

The image will automatically scale to fit the width of the article.

<img src="/doc/images/MTR/room-bar-mtr.png" />
