# USB Passthrough for seamless device connections

When you connect your laptop to a Cisco device using USB Passthrough, you can use the device's advanced features, such as its camera, microphone, and loudspeakers, during video calls from your laptop meeting apps. This integration ensures superior video and sound quality, enhancing your overall conferencing experience.

The setup and use of this feature varies because the different devices have different capabilities:

* **Full USB-C support**: Desk Pro, Board Pro, Board Pro G2, Room Kit EQ, Room Kit EQX, Room Bar, Room Bar Pro
* **No USB-C support**: Codec Pro

## Full USB-C support

Devices in this category have a USB-C connector, and you can share content from a laptop to the device on the USB-C connection.

### Connect your laptop and select input sources

1. *(Optional, and only for devices with a touch controller)* Tap **Call from laptop** on the touch controller, and it guides you what to do next.
2. Connect your laptop to the device's USB-C socket.
3. Open your laptop meeting app and select the device as source for camera, microphone, and loudspeaker. Now you are ready to call or join a meeting from your laptop.


### In-call behavior

You can always mute your microphones from the laptop meeting app. Whether you can mute from the device depends on how your administrator has set up the device. The device and laptop mute indicators are not synchronized. 

The device is in **Do not disturb** mode when you are in a video meeting from your laptop. You won't receive any other incoming calls to your device when in this mode. The device is **not** in **Do not disturb** mode when in audio-only meetings.

You can control the camera, adjust the volume, remove background noise, and optimize the audio quality, from the device UI. The camera light indicator is on when the camera is in use. The laptop meeting app controls the rest, including disconnecting the call.

## No USB-C support

The devices in this category don't have a USB-C connector, so an HDMI-to-USB converter must be connected to one of the device's HDMI outputs. You'll need to connect both a USB and an HDMI cable to the laptop.
