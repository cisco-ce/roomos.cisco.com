# Secure your devices with a user based PIN lock


Enhance the security of all your devices, including hot desking stations, by enabling user-based PIN lock. This ensures your data remains protected and your notifications stay private and discreet. 

**Note**: This Feature requires MTR device to be managed in Webex Control Hub. Read [this article]([https://help.webex.com/en-us/article/preview/nokp2m5/Secure-your-Board,-Desk,-or-Room-Series-devices-with-a-user-based-PIN-lock]) to learn how to set up the PIN code for all of your devices.
**Note**: The device PIN feature is no longer supported and will be replaced by a user-based PIN system, allowing users to manage their PINs across devices.

With a personal 6-digit PIN, you can keep your private information safe. When your device is locked, sensitive data like calendars, call records, and whiteboards are inaccessible. Important notifications continue to reach you without revealing details, and emergency calling remains functional. Upcoming meeting alerts are only seen if the device is configured with Webex Hybrid calendar.

If configured, emergency calling is available even in locked state.
