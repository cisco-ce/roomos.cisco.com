## Virtual Backgrounds

With virtual backgrounds, you can change or blur the background of the image others see in the video meeting. This helps you to be the focus of the image or hide a messy background at the office. 
From the self-view image, you can change your virtual background. You can change the background before or when you're already in a call or a meeting.
Background options:
* Background blur
* Standard background images

1.	Swipe right on the home screen to open the control panel.
2.	Tap **Background** under your self-view. 

## To change your background during a call

Tap the screen to get the call controls and self-view if not already visible. Then tap the background button on your self-view. 
The available options appear. Choose one and tap anywhere else on the screen.
