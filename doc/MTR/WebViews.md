# Display web content 

We're adding web-view and web-modal features to the MTR platform making it possible to display web content, allowing users to interact with web applications or content directly from the MTR interface.
This is useful for things like getting assistance in a room, tracking issues, or using interactive web apps. In MTR mode, you can launch these web extensions either automatically through predefined actions or from the side panel extension option. To use this feature, simply enroll your devices in Webex Control Hub.

## Usage

xcommand UserInterface WebView Display Mode: Fullscreen
