# Using Cisco device APIs to address hybrid work scenarios

## Overview

With Cisco video devices you have the ability to have meetings from anywhere. The value to the user is that they have an experience that is inclusive, flexible, supportive, managed and secure. The outcomes are meetings that are easy to set up with space management platforms, engaging, productive and drive a sense of belonging to improve employee retention. Similarly the employees well being can be improved with supportive hybrid work that is safe, ergonomic , sanitized and improves sustainability

This document gives an overview for integrators, be they resellers or software solution partners, to understand how they can configure and program with API’s for customers’ specific requirements for their organization and how they manage their employees engagement , well being and workflow.

## Resources

For those that are not familiar with Cisco API’s there are 2 resources that will enable you to gain a deep understanding of what is possible.

https://developer.webex.com – this is for all API’s related to the whole Webex platform (Calling, Meetings, Messaging, Contact Center, Webex Assistant, Admin, FedRAMP and devices) Sign Up for free and explore all the capabilities

https://roomos.cisco.com – this is specifically for developing on RoomOS, which is the operating system for Cisco video devices and keeps it all under the realm of devices without all of the other Webex Platform elements above. At the same time there are specific macros examples for devices with the code on Github as examples.

## Use cases

<img src="/docs/images/usecases/hybriduser.png" />

The use cases are associated to where the person is working from and how to engage with them at that place.  For devices that you can program this will likely be a static place, such as the home, office, hot desk, conference room, huddle space, board room, phone booth kiosk etc.

The table below displays the use cases, what the outcomes can be and which API’s you should look at and integrate with a 3rd party platform if needed. Many API’s are considered xAPI’s which means they can be executed with Control Hub, which is the cloud management system, not requiring an individual call to the device itself, allowing for scaling of commands and use cases and centralizing.

## Hybrid work solutions

The following use cases will be covered at a high level.  Many of the API’s can be mixed as well to cover multiple use cases:

* Space management
  * Enhanced version of room booking often including hot desks
* Visitor registration
  * Using devices to check in visitors
* Team and personal communications
  * Often referred to as digital signage when applied to teams, but can be used on Desk devices as well (Desk Mini / Desk / Desk Pro) for personal use
* Well being
  * Includes engagement (social and emotional well being) , and environmentals (physical well being)
* Hotdesking
* Wayfinding & mapping
* Visual collaboration
  * Often various forms of whiteboarding from basic to advanced)
* Spatial analytics
  * Often used for planning purposes and driving real time behavior on devices
