<b>** These devices are NOT supported with RoomOS 11.1.2.x. Support was added in RoomOS 11.5.2.4 </b> <br>
Note: If you have upgraded an unsupported device to RoomOS 11.1.2.x it will not damage the device but it will not work as expected. If you end up in a situation where you have upgraded an unsupported device, it is possible to downgrade normally using the web interface or other methods. Support for these devices was introduced in RoomOS 11.5.2.4.

The software described in this document is released to [https://www.cisco.com](https://software.cisco.com/download/home/283611944?catid=280789323) for on-premises deployment. If you register a Room Device to Webex you will be upgraded to the latest RoomOS cloud version available. RoomOS cloud software is not supported for on-premises deployment unless you are linked to **Webex Edge for Devices with Cloud Software Management enabled**. 

You can tell the difference between a cloud and on-premises RoomOS version by looking at the third version number. For example: 

* 11.X.**1**.x = Cloud 
* 11.X.**X > 1**.x = On-premises 

**RoomOS 11 is based on RoomOS 10 but have major upgrades**

This means that the first release of RoomOS 11 inherits most of the same underlying features seen in RoomOS 10.19.4.2 as of February 2023. The big difference is that RoomOS 11 comes with a powerful new user interface known as the RoomOS 11 UI Experience. This UI could optionally be enabled on RoomOS 10 for preview. In the future, there will be a feature gap between RoomOS 10 and RoomOS 11 since RoomOS 11 will be running on newer products and get new features tailored for the new UI. 

RoomOS 11 can be downloaded [here](https://software.cisco.com/download/home/283611944?catid=280789323).

## General notes and warnings for RoomOS 11
Please read this before upgrading to RoomOS 11

NOTE: We have previously announced that SNMP would be removed from RoomOS 11. RoomOS 11 will continue to support basic SNMPv2 and SNMPv3. 

<a name='announcement-1-2023'></a>

**RoomOS 10 will soon be deprecated and EOS**<br>
The next on-premises software release for RoomOS 11 targeted end of June 2023 will make RoomOS 10 obsolete and end of support. Cisco supports and releases new software versions for two minor software releases per product. Since all products that have support for RoomOS 10 also have support for RoomOS 11, the RoomOS 10 software line will go end of support quicker than for example CE9 that several legacy products still depends on. 

RoomOS 10 will not be removed from cisco.com right away, but will likely happen during the first quarter of 2024. Please prepare your devices and environment for upgrade to RoomOS 11 in order to stay on supported software.  

**Provisioning Mode "VCS" will soon be obsolete**<br>
The setting "xConfiguration Provisioning Mode: VCS" will be deprecated in one of the next RoomOS 11 minor releases. This provisioning mode has been used for TMS Provisioning Extension (TMSPE) and is no longer supported. 

**Facility service is deprecated**<br>
Facility Service  is deprecated from RoomOS 11 software because quick dial functionality can be created using [UI Extensions and macros](https://roomos.cisco.com/macros/Speed%20Dials%20Panel). 

**Snap to whiteboard**<br>
Snap to whiteboard is not available in RoomOS 11

**Software files have changed - specific upgrade paths may be applicable**<br>
We have made a permanent change on the upgrade files that we release for our devices. This is a very important change and we recommend you to read the updated [software upgrade section](#software-upgrade) in this document. In short, we have deprecated the xx.k3.cop.sgn files by only releasing xx.k4.cop.sha512 files as these are signed with a more secure signature. This may affect your upgrade path depending on what software version you are currently upgrading from. We have released the xx.k4.cop.sha512 files for a while together with the xx.k3.cop.sgn files but the latter is now deprecated.

## Notes and warnings for this software release

### Passphrase requirement

RoomOS 11.27.2.0 and above has a new passphrase policy that require the user to change the passphrase after logging in for the first time with the default passphrase. Please read more about it in the [section](#112720-1) below.

<hr style='width: 70%'>

## RoomOS 11.27.3.0

RoomOS 11.27.3.0 is a patch release and contains only bugfixes.<br>

<br><br>

# RoomOS 11.27.2.0 feature descriptions 

<a name='112720-1'></a>

## Require passphrase change on first login

This change affects video devices running RoomOS 11.27.2.0 or later that are in a factory reset state—either newly received devices or devices that have been manually reset.

To comply with EU regulations and enhance device security, a passphrase is now required for the device admin account. By default, no passphrase is set, and you must create one before using the device.

During the standard setup process, you'll be prompted to set a passphrase via the setup wizard. Once set, you can use it to log in normally.

However, if you attempt to access the device through the web interface or other methods (e.g., SSH), you will be required to change the passphrase before access is granted.

Important: If you use automation or scripted routines to configure devices, note that SSH access now requires a passphrase update. These scripts must be adapted to handle this new requirement during setup. 

<a name='112720-2'></a>

## Director to use Virtual Lens

This feature automatically extends the camera's reach using an AI-powered virtual lens, ensuring that active speakers—such as those seated at the far end of a long table—are captured in higher quality. No configuration or user interaction is required.

<a name='112720-3'></a>

## AirPlay FairPlay support

Our AirPlay implementation now supports FairPlay and can now playback DRM protected content in out-of-call scenarios. Protected content will never play in call sharing scenarios. 

Note that applications that has no support for FairPlay, such as Netflix will not be able to playback content using AirPlay on the Room Devices. 

<a name='112720-4'></a>

## Screen-reader support (Accessibility)

We're introducing a new accessibility feature designed to improve usability for visually impaired users. Once enabled, the touch screen can be operated using specific gestures.

To enable the screen reader, tap the screen with three fingers and swipe down. The screen reader will begin reading aloud the item currently selected. You can then navigate the interface by swiping to move between elements such as Call, Share, and more. When the desired option is selected, double-tap anywhere on the screen to activate it. When using the keypad, each selected letter will also be read aloud.

To disable the screen reader, repeat the same gesture: tap with three fingers and swipe down.

<a name='112720-5'></a>

## Webview in share tray

Previously, it was not possible to access or share a webview directly. With this update, when a webview is launched, it will now appear in the share tray, allowing users to easily select and share it during a call or meeting.

We've also added support in the APIs to allow integrators to share webviews programmatically using the following command:
xCommand Presentation Start PresentationSource: WebView WebViewId: ID

The xStatus UserInterface WebView node provides the WebViewId, and the WebView X Sharing status will indicate "True" when a webview is actively being shared.

This feature simplifies integration for developers and improves usability by allowing users to choose which webview to share—or to identify which one is currently being shared.

<a name='112720-6'></a>

## Whitebalance calibration for multicamera setup

In a multicamera setup using Cross View, differences in white balance can make the video feeds appear inconsistent — especially when PTZ 4K cameras are used as side cameras. To address this, we’ve introduced three white balance profiles. When you select a profile on the touch panel, the video inputs will be displayed on screen, allowing you to compare them and choose the profile that best suits your meeting room.

To access this feature, open the touch panel, go to Device Settings, then Cameras, and select White Balance. From there, you can view and test the different profiles directly with the live video inputs.

# Release summary for RoomOS 11.24

## Notes and warnings for this software release

### AV Integrator Option no longer required for more than 3 Cisco Microphone Pro/Ceiling Microphone Pro

The AV Integrator Option is still required to unlock Audio Console (Codec EQ/EQX) and AES67. However, we have removed the need for this option when adding more than three Cisco Microphone Pro units.

Cisco Room Bar Pro, Board Pro, Board Pro G2, Codec EQ, EQX, and Room Kit EQ now support up to eight Cisco Microphone Pro or Ceiling Microphone Pro units without requiring the AV Integrator Option key.

Additionally, Cisco Room Bar now supports one Ceiling Microphone Pro (or one Cisco Microphone Pro) still without the need for the AV Integrator Option.

### Samsung QMH firmware 

Due to an issue with the Samsung QMH Series where Cisco Room devices in some scenarios are unable to wake up the screens from standby we have released a Firmware that will improve this behavior.
The Samsung QMH Firmware is found on the respective product pages together with the normal RoomOS software. 

For update instructions follow the instructions provided in the "Update using USB" section here: https://www.samsung.com/us/support/answer/ANS00062224/

<a name='112424-2'></a>

## Support for Cisco Ceiling Microphone Pro

RoomOS 11.24.2.4 has full support for the Cisco Ceiling Microphone Pro together with supported systems. [Click here to read more about the Cisco Ceiling Microphone Pro](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/collateral/collaboration-endpoints/collaboration-peripherals/ceiling-microphone-pro-ds.html) 

<a name='112424-3'></a>

## Support for Cisco Room Bar BYOD 

With RoomOS 11.24.2 and later installed on a Cisco Room Bar without a Room Navigator connected, the device will boot into Cisco Room Bar BYOD mode. This feature is distinct from "Call from Laptop" and requires that no touch panels or touch screens are connected to the Cisco Room Bar in addition to being i factory default mode. In BYOD mode, the Room Bar can be connected via USB-C or USB-A to USB-C, functioning as an advanced web camera that provides audio input and output, video with built-in intelligent framing, and local presentation capabilities when connected to a screen.

If a Cisco Room Navigator is connected, the device will automatically exit BYOD mode and function as a standard Cisco Room Bar. To return to BYOD mode, the Room Navigator must be disconnected, and the Cisco Room Bar must undergo a factory reset.

The Cisco Room Bar BYOD can operate in three configurations. In the first, the device is not connected to any network via cable or Wi-Fi. Network connectivity is unnecessary in this setup, and the Room Bar serves as a web camera, microphone, and speaker system for a connected laptop. It can also act as a presentation device when a screen is connected to the HDMI output. In this no-network mode, access to device configurations is limited, so the default volume level set to 70% (as opposed to the standard 50%). Audio control must be managed from the connected laptop. Some providers may not allow volume adjustments on digital audio devices, requiring the Cisco Room Bar to manage volume. Configuration changes in no-network mode can only be made using a serial connection to the xAPI.

When the Room Bar has network connectivity, either through Wi-Fi or Ethernet, additional configuration options become available via the web interface. Most settings and commands can be accessed, although the user interface remains limited in certain areas, such as displaying web views, custom prompts and alerts. However, functionalities like [xConfiguration UserInterface CustomMessage](https://roomos.cisco.com/xapi/Configuration.UserInterface.CustomMessage/) are still supported. 

To connect the device to Wi-Fi (if supported), there are two options. The first involves using a serial connection to the xAPI and configuring Wi-Fi details with the [xCommand Network Wifi Configure](https://roomos.cisco.com/xapi/Command.Network.Wifi.Configure/) command. The device will connect to the Wi-Fi network within a few seconds if the configuration is correct. The second option is to use an SSH connection to the device's xAPI while it is connected to the network via Ethernet. The same command can be used to configure Wi-Fi details, after which the Ethernet cable can be removed, allowing the device to connect to the configured Wi-Fi network.

When the Cisco Room Bar in BYOD mode has network connectivity, it can also be registered to Webex. This allows pairing with Webex clients for making calls and adds the device to Control Hub for simplified management. Registering the Room Bar to Webex in BYOD mode also enables automatic software updates.

<a name='112424-4'></a>

## Support for local ad-hoc bookings ahead of time

The local booking UI for ad-hoc bookings now allow you to book the room ahead of time. 

<a name='112424-5'></a>

## AirPlay auto share popup

When AirPlay is connected during a call, an auto-share popup will appear, notifying the user that sharing will begin in 5 seconds and providing a countdown until the content is shared in the call. The popup can be dismissed by tapping outside of it or selecting "Dismiss," which will cancel the content share.

<a name='112424-6'></a>

## Content preview in share tray for cabled sources

When you connect a content source, such as a PC, a snapshot of its content appears in the share tray. This helps you quickly identify the correct source. Note that this do not work for the Extended/Virtual sources feature event though the source is connected via Cable. 

<a name='112424-7'></a>

## Release of Microsoft Teams Panel software for local upgrades

For standalone Room Navigators that is running Microsoft Teams Panel we will be releasing a software package for local upgrades. 

See the updated list of released software packages in the software section. 

<a name='112424-8'></a>

## Support for RFC5922 Domain Certificate in SIP 

Support for Domain Certificate verification in SIP according to RFC5922. The setting xConfiguration SIP TransportSecurity CertificateVerificationMode can be configured to one of three modes: Auto, Legacy, or RFC5922. In Auto or Legacy mode, verification is disabled. 

### Related xAPI Configurations

The mode RFC5922 specifies how to validate names in an X.509 certificate received from a SIP remote. To enforce certificate verification for SIP calls, the following xConfiguration parameters must also be set:

xConfiguration SIP DefaultTransport: Tls
<br>xConfiguration SIP TlsVerify: On
<br>xConfiguration SIP ListenPort: Off 

Note that the SIP ListenPort mode Off will effectively block incoming SIP calls. 

### Special Considerations

Even if RFC5922 is enabled via the configuration above, it will be automatically disabled under the following conditions:

xConfiguration Provisioning WebexCalling Mode: On
<br>xConfiguration SIP Type: Cisco
<br>xConfiguration SIP Proxy 1 Address: "non-empty"

<a name='112023-1'></a>

## Improvements when joining Zoom meetings

In the Join Zoom interface, you will now see a list of selectable Zoom CRC domains under the "Advanced Options" for data center location preferences. 

A new feature has been introduced that automatically detects when you're dialing into a Zoom meeting from xCommand Dial (or from the normal UI Call interface). If a Zoom meeting is detected, Zoom Call Controls will be added to the user interface. Previously, these controls were only available when joining a meeting through the Join Zoom UI. Please note that if you join a meeting via xCommand Dial using a booking ID, the platform specified in the booking will take priority.

We are now also removing the visual Zoom DTMF menu automatically if we detect a Zoom meeting by adding an option to the dial string. For example, 123456789@zoomcrc.com will become 123456789..504@zoomcrc.com.

This addition happens automatically and will not cause issues even if the option is already present, as Zoom supports duplicate options.

This addition of the 504 option disables the Zoom DTMF menu, leaving only our enhanced Zoom Call Controls, ensuring a better user experience.

If you'd prefer to use the Zoom visual menu instead of our call controls, you can disable this feature by setting xConfiguration Zoom EnhancedCallControls to "disabled." This will disable the Zoom enhanced call controls all together.

## Improved local share for devices in MTR mode

This update brings significant quality improvements when previewing your screen in MTR mode on Cisco devices, including:

- 4K screen previews with cable
- Higher resolution Miracast previews
- Support for up to 3 screens and multisource viewing (on multiscreen devices)
- Touch redirect for Windows laptops

Note: These features apply to out-of-call MTR mode only.

## Expanded Cisco Table Microphone Pro and AES67 support

We’ve added support for up to 8 Cisco Table Microphone Pro units for the Cisco Board Pro/G2 (requires the "AV Integrator" Option Key). The Cisco Board Pro/G2 also now supports AES67.

Additionally, the Cisco Room Bar now supports connecting one (1) Cisco Table Microphone Pro.

<a name='112023-4'></a>

## Support one additional passive screen when using a third-party touch screen

You can connect one third-party touchscreen (introduced in RoomOS 11.14) and one passive screen (new in RoomOS 11.20) to the Room Series device, and there are two possible setup options:

Option 1: Screen 1 (left) as an interactive touchscreen and Screen 2 (right) as a passive screen

In this configuration, interactive content will shift from Screen 2 to Screen 1 when, for example, annotating on an incoming presentation.

Connect Screen 1's HDMI cable to connector 1.
Connect Screen 1's USB cable to the USB-A port for touch functionality.
Connect Screen 2's HDMI cable to connector 2.

Option 2: Screen 1 (left) as a passive screen and Screen 2 (right) as an interactive touchscreen

Here, content during a call will always be shown on Screen 2, whether it's interactive or not. Outside of a call, all interactive apps and elements will also be displayed on Screen 2.

Connect Screen 1's display cable to connector 1.
Connect Screen 2's display cable to connector 2.
Connect Screen 2's USB cable to the USB-A port for touch recognition.

To finalize the setup, configure the following setting:

xConfiguration UserInterface OSD Output: 2

Limitations:

Touch redirect is not supported.
Active styluses are not supported. Passive styluses may work.

## Allow Microsoft teams meetings on different tenants through VIMT

Allow existing VIMT (Video Interoperability Meeting Tenant) customers to seamlessly join Microsoft Teams meetings hosted by external tenants while maintaining the familiar Cloud Video Interop (CVI) experience. 

This ensures that users can continue to leverage their VIMT setup for enhanced video quality and functionality, even when participating in meetings outside their home tenant, delivering consistent and optimized meeting experiences across different organizations.

<a name='112023-6'></a>

## Extended reach speaker mode

Get a front-row seat, wherever you are placed in the meeting space. 

Adaptive speaker tracking and intelligent framing by the Cisco Quad Camera and the Cisco PTZ 4K pan-tilt-zoom camera, capture the active speaker and other in-room participants, even in the largest spaces.

<a name='112023-7'></a>

## Added support for Cinematic meetings (CrossView)

Cross-view is an AI-driven feature that enhances meetings with a cinematic experience by using two PTZ 4K or Quad cameras, along with a Codec EQ or Pro and Table Microphones Pro. The system analyzes room activity, identifies speakers, and tracks where participants are facing to automatically select the best camera angle. This setup ensures comprehensive coverage of discussions, even across the table, for more inclusive hybrid meetings.

Please note, connecting more than one Quad Camera to a Codec is only supported for Cross-view. To achieve the best results, it's important to follow the recommended setup guidelines.

For more information read the Cross View Setup guidelines by following this link:

[Cross-view setup guidelines](https://www.cisco.com/c/dam/en/us/td/docs/telepresence/endpoint/camera/cross-view_guidelines.pdf)

<a name='112023-8'></a>

## Pointing and annotation improvements on live presentations

This feature allows presenters to live annotate and point directly on their presentations in real-time.

Previously, a snapshot was taken of the presentation to draw on, but with this update, the presentation continues beneath the drawings.

Additionally, a new tool, disappearing ink, has been introduced. It stays visible for about 5 seconds, helping presenters highlight key elements without interrupting the flow of the presentation.

<a name='112023-9'></a>

## Frames improvements

The updated framing for groups of 2-4 people ensures that participants are no longer displayed in multiple frames.

For groups of 5-6 participants, the new framing limits the display to two frames, providing a more stable and cohesive viewing experience.

<a name='112023-10'></a>

## Support for custom Cisco Scheduler setups without need for Webex Calendar

We have added an option to enable ad-hoc bookings on a Room Device without having any integrations to a Webex Hybrid Calendar. This feature involves several new xConfigurations and xCommands for custom bookings. 

[xConfiguration Bookings AdhocBooking Enabled](https://roomos.cisco.com/xapi/Configuration.Bookings.AdhocBooking.Enabled/)

Enable or disable ad-hoc booking on the device

[xConfiguration UserInterface RoomScheduler Mode](https://roomos.cisco.com/xapi/Configuration.UserInterface.RoomScheduler.Mode/)

Configure the scheduler to display the device calendar or only if the room is in use or available. 

[xCommand Bookings Book](https://roomos.cisco.com/xapi/Command.Bookings.Book/)

Book a meeting via the xAPI

```
xCommand Bookings Book BookingRequestUUID: 1 MeetingPlatform: Webex Number: meeting@example.com OrganizerName: "Booker" Protocol: Spark Title: "Webex Local Booking"

OK
*r BookingsBookResult (status=OK):
** end
```

[xCommand Bookings Edit](https://roomos.cisco.com/xapi/Command.Bookings.Edit/)

Edit a booking via the xAPI

```
xCommand Bookings Edit MeetingId: 1 Title: "MS Local Booking" Number: "differentmeeting@example.com" MeetingPlatform: MicrosoftTeams

OK
*r BookingsEditResult (status=OK):
** end
```

Booking events for third-party integrations: [Bookings Events](https://roomos.cisco.com/xapi/Command.Bookings.Edit/?search=bookings&Type=Event)

<a name='112023-11'></a>

## Added support for Hot Spaces (Cisco Webex Board series)

Note: Applies to Webex Edge for Devices deployments with RoomOS 11.20.2.3 and above.

Introducing hot spacing support for Boards, Board Pros, and Board Pro G2s similar to what we already have for Cisco Desk Series devices in the same deployment model. 

This update brings a new user experience to Boards, enabling hot spacing features that were previously exclusive to Desk series devices (hot desking). 

It allows automatic saving and retrieval of whiteboards to users' accounts, minimizing the need for binding spaces. 

Sign-in will now be triggered via QR code pairing, eliminating the need for USB-C pairing. 

The half wake function will remain the same unless a user is signed in, in which case the Reserved screen will be displayed.

# Release summary for RoomOS 11.17 

## Notes and warnings for this software release

### HTTP proxy authentication available in all proxy modes

In earlier software versions, RoomOS has only supported HTTP proxy authentication when NetworkServices HTTP Proxy Mode has been set to Manual. Now, HTTP proxy authentication is also supported when using proxies through PAC and WPAD files.

The authentication data is configured using the NetworkServices HTTP Proxy LoginName and Password settings.

This feature requires the NetworkServices CommonProxy setting to be set to Enabled. This setting will be removed once the switchover to the new proxy support module (common proxy) is complete.

### Configuration to allow legacy ciphers 

In a previous release, we removed support for the diffie-Hellman-group14-sha1-key-exchange cipher. This resulted in a breaking change for some customers using integration equipment with limited support for newer ciphers. Although this cipher is considered insecure by security scanners, we have implemented a configuration option to disable it to ensure backward compatibility.

You can find the configuration option here: [xConfiguration NetworkServices SSH KeyExchangeAlgorithms AllowLegacy](https://roomos.cisco.com/xapi/Configuration.NetworkServices.SSH.KeyExchangeAlgorithms.AllowLegacy/). The default setting is "On" to prevent disruptions to existing integrations during an upgrade. However, Cisco does not recommend using older ciphers and encourages customers to transition their integration systems to equipment supporting modern ciphers. To avoid security scanners flagging this cipher, set this configuration to "Off".

<br><br>

# RoomOS 11.17.2.2 feature descriptions 

<a name='111722-1'></a>

## Updated the Settings Menu UI

The settings menu UI is now adapted to the rest of the UI design. 

<a name='111722-2'></a>

## Added support for Networked Standby for Board Pro

Networked standby is already supported for most of the products, this is now added to the Board Pro

<a name='111722-3'></a>

## Added support for selecting USB Mode

Some laptops do not support video bulk transfer over USB3. Since our products use bulk mode video streaming, using some USB-C cables with USB3 can cause intermittent video streaming issues on these laptops.

To address this, we have introduced a new configuration feature that allows users to switch between USB2 and USB3 modes in such situations. 

Users can make these configuration changes via the codec web UI or over SSH.

Please note that after adjusting the configuration, a system reboot is required.

<a name='111722-4'></a>

## Added support to set Max Resolution

The "xConfiguration Video Input Connector N PreferredResolution" setting softly enforces the preferred resolution, allowing the source to override it and choose a higher resolution if needed.

With the introduction of "xConfiguration Video Input Connector N MaxResolution," a hard limit is set by removing all resolutions above the specified value from the codec input EDID.

To change the Video Input MaxResolution, you need to specify the input and select the MaxResolution. Note that the available values depend on what is supported for that input.

Example:

`xConfiguration Video Input Connector[N] MaxResolution: <1920_1080_60, 3840_2160_30>`

<a name='111722-5'></a>

## Check-in / Check-out of meetings

This feature allows room resources to be freed up if the host does not "Check-in" when the meeting starts and within the set timeout. 

The meeting booking will be removed and free up the space for others to use. This is a feature that helps to avoid unspent resources being blocked. 

<a name='111722-6'></a>

## Improved support for certificate responders

With this feature, the application can always verify the revocation status of a certificate, especially when stapled OCSP responses are unavailable, thus maintaining secure and trustworthy communications.

In summary, enabling the enhanced revocation checking feature in WebEngine allows the application to perform more accurate and current checks on the revocation status of digital certificates, ensuring higher security.

In order to enable this feature you have to enable: xConfiguration WebEngine Certificates RevocationChecks NetworkAccess: <Allow/Deny> where Deny is the default setting (Which means that it is "Off" by default).

Note

WebEngine does not require 'Network Services HTTPS OCSP Mode' to be set to 'On' for performing certificate revocation checks ('Revocation Checks'). Even if DNS resolution or network access to the OCSP responder over TCP port 80 is unavailable, WebEngine performs a 'fail-open', where revocation checks do not prevent connection completion.

When 'NetworkAccess' is set to 'Deny', and there is no 'stapled response', no revocation checks are performed, yet the connection still completes. This means that in scenarios where network access to the OCSP responder is blocked, and no 'stapled response' is available, WebEngine will still allow the HTTPS connection to complete without further revocation checks.

# Release summary for RoomOS 11.14 

## Notes and warnings for this software release

Version 11.14.2.3 of RoomOS introduces updates to the Macro Framework, along with additional enhancements such as HDMI output for Cisco Desk and Cisco Board Pro, and serial outbound connection capabilities through the xAPI.

### Updated the Macro framework to use QuickJS by default 

While this should not cause any problems and the upgrade should be transparent for you, there is a known limitation related to this. [Click here](#111423-9) to learn more. 

### The phone capabilities are no longer always sent

CSCwi79191	CDP and VLAN config should allow to enable CDP but not join voiceVLAN

Previously, the phone flag was activated regardless of whether the xConfiguration Network 1 VLAN Voice Mode was enabled or disabled, which was not in line with the specifications. Moving forward, we will only activate the phone flag when this configuration is set to "On".

<br><br>

# RoomOS 11.14.2.3 feature descriptions 

<a name='111423-1'></a>

## Extended shape library and text-in-shapes when using Whiteboard

Introduced new features that allow for the insertion of text into shapes and added a square shape with rounded corners.

<a name='111423-2'></a>

## Custom buttons in control panel

This update enhances the UI Extensions by allowing custom buttons to be added to the side panel (on touch screen devices) or the control panel of the Cisco Room Navigator. Configuration of these buttons is managed within the UI extensions editor, where their placement can be specified. These custom buttons function identically to standard ones, supporting interaction with macros.

<a name='111423-3'></a>

## Support third-party touch screens

Support is now available for selected third-party touch screens, compatible with the Room Bar, Room Bar Pro, Room Kit EQ, and Codec Pro devices.

To activate third-party touch screen functionality, adjust the settings as follows:

Enable the feature by setting xConfiguration UserInterface ExternalTouchScreen Enabled to True.
The xConfiguration Peripherals Profile TouchPanels now includes 'Auto' in its value space for easier configuration.
Activating this feature provides support for third-party touch screens, similar to the Board experience, and introduces whiteboard for devices previously lacking these capabilities.

Connect the touch-enabled display to the first HDMI connector and attach a USB cable for touch functionality. The process is automatic once the feature is enabled.

Currently, support is limited to one touch screen per device. If a device supports multiple screens, additional screens cannot be connected alongside the touch screen. Future updates may allow for both a touch and a passive screen simultaneously.

Officially supported touch screen models include:

Dell C and P Series
Samsung WAC-series

<a name='111423-4'></a>

## Dual screen support (HDMI OUT) for Desk Pro and Board Pro

We are excited to announce the new HDMI output feature for the Desk Pro and Board Pro devices, enabling the connection of a second monitor to create a dynamic dual-screen video system. This enhancement allows users to extend their workspace, increasing productivity and interaction during meetings.

With the HDMI out feature, users can now leverage the power of a second monitor to display additional content, visuals, or reference materials, providing a more immersive and comprehensive meeting experience. This functionality is ideal for facilitating extended discussions, conducting training sessions, and collaborating more effectively on projects.

The dual-screen setup promotes better engagement and collaboration by allowing participants to view shared content simultaneously on both the primary device and the secondary monitor. This extended display capability improves visibility and ensures that all participants have a clear view of the presentation or discussion, enhancing the overall communication and understanding. 

Moreover, the HDMI output on the Desk Pro and Board Pro supports easy connection to external displays or projectors, offering flexibility and ensuring compatibility with a broad range of display devices. This feature simplifies the setup process and enhances the meeting environment, making it more versatile and productive.

Embrace the full potential of your meetings with the Desk Pro and Board Pro's HDMI output capability, designed to deliver impactful, engaging, and efficiently communicated sessions to all participants.

To activate the HDMI Out feature, users can navigate to the side menu and device settings to turn it on. This action requires a one-time device restart to implement the change. After rebooting, the device will automatically recognize signals from the HDMI port. Should the HDMI connection be removed later, the device will seamlessly transition back to a single screen setup without needing further actions from the user.

<a name='111423-5'></a>

## Support for USB serial outbound connections

This new feature enables you to establish outbound serial connections, allowing you to send commands directly to third-party equipment. In the past, only external devices could connect to our serial interface to issue commands. 

The outbound serial port control in the system operates on a connectionless model, where the serial port connection between the codec and the peripheral is not constant. Instead, the connection is established only when a command is issued through xCommand SerialPort PeripheralControl Send and terminates once the command execution is complete. This transient connection approach facilitates direct command communication with peripherals like projectors and monitors.

In terms of configuration, the outbound serial port control feature encompasses several adjustable parameters under xConfiguration SerialPort Outbound. These include the mode, which toggles the outbound control feature on or off, and the Port[1], which signifies the current support for a single serial port with an anticipation of future expansion to multiple ports. The BaudRate parameter allows the user to set the speed of data transmission, while the Description field provides a means to describe the connected peripheral device (cosmetic). Additionally, the Parity setting adjusts the parity bit to ensure the accuracy of the transmitted data. Please refer to the third-party equipment documentation to see their command and connectivity specifications.

The core command for outbound serial data transmission, xCommand SerialPort PeripheralControl Send, incorporates several parameters such as PortId, which is set to 1 by default, ResponseTerminator, and ResponseTimeout, which define how the codec processes the response from the peripheral. The Text parameter specifies the actual data to be sent, with functionality to include special characters.

Response handling in the codec is refined through the ResponseTerminator and ResponseTimeout settings. The ResponseTerminator enables the codec to buffer the response until a specified delimiter is met, filtering the data effectively. For instance, if set to "\n", the codec captures the response up to this character, ignoring any further data. This mechanism works in tandem with ResponseTimeout, dictating the duration the codec waits for a peripheral's response, capped at 5000 milliseconds. Absence of a ResponseTimeout setting results in the immediate conclusion of the command post-data transmission, bypassing the response phase. This intricate setup enhances the efficiency and flexibility of managing serial communications with third-party peripherals.

<a name='111423-6'></a>

## Management of paired Room Navigators

RoomOS 11.14.2 enables the management of a remotely paired Room Navigator. Previously, pairing a Room Navigator prohibited access to the CLI and Web UI on the Room Navigator itself. Now, it's possible to create a new user directly on the Room Navigator using the device xAPI.

To start, find the ID of the navigator you want to manage in the xStatus section under Peripherals. Then, enable device management with the command xCommand Peripherals DeviceManagement Enable ID: XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX.

Next, you can create a new user on the Room Navigator with the command xCommand Peripherals UserManagement User Add Username: touchuser Passphrase: "<>" YourPassphrase: "<>" Active: True Role: Admin ID: XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX. Note that the username "admin" is reserved and should not be altered.

Once enabled, you can access the Room Navigator using its IP address through SSH or HTTPS (Web UI) for additional management.

If you disable device management using xCommand Peripherals DeviceManagement Disable ID: XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX, it will delete all the accounts created and block access to the CLI and Web UI.

Managing the Room Navigator is useful for updating 802.1x Certificates or when other management or integration needs arise.

<a name='111423-7'></a>

## Support for controlling multiple lenses in the camera control menu

With the standard camera controls, you can now choose specific lenses to set up presets or check various views in self-view. This selection feature is available if your camera, like the Cisco Quad Camera, has multiple lenses.

<a name='111423-11'></a>

## Support for Cisco Board Pro 55 and 75 G2

RoomOS 11.14.2 adds support for a new device, the Cisco Board Pro 55 and 75 G2.

Cisco® Board Pro G2 is an all-in-one, integrated video device and collaboration board that offers a complete hybrid meeting room solution to remove the distance between in-room and remote participants. It is an intelligent video conferencing appliance combining a dual camera system, built-in speakers and microphones, an interactive touch screen, an AI-powered computing engine, and several mounting options to customize the experience.

<a name='111423-8'></a>

## Added new diagnostics for Web Views when facing out of memory issues

This feature is solely for diagnostics purposes and aids in pinpointing situations where the web app consumes excessive memory, leading to crashes in the integrated web engine. Given the web engine's limited resource allocation, it may crash if the web app demands more memory than available. Previously, the cause of such crashes was not clearly conveyed to users. Now, a dismissible diagnostic message will appear when this occurs.

<a name='111423-9'></a>

## Macro Engine update

We've updated the Macro Framework to utilize QuickJS as its default engine, replacing Ducktape. This change should not affect your workflow, but there is an important note to consider. If you use the CLI to save macros, specifically through the [xCommand Macros Macro Save](https://roomos.cisco.com/xapi/Command.Macros.Macro.Save/) command, ensure that the Transpile parameter is set to False. Additionally, you must configure [xConfiguration Macros EvaluateTranspiled](https://roomos.cisco.com/xapi/Configuration.Macros.EvaluateTranspiled/) to False. We plan to fix this in an upcoming release. Note that saving macros via the browser (UI) does not encounter this problem.

<a name='111423-10'></a>

## Easier deployment of AirPlay

Administrators no longer have to set the [xConfiguration Bluetooth Enabled](https://roomos.cisco.com/xapi/Configuration.Bluetooth.Enabled/) to "True" for emitting Airplay BLE beacons. This simplifies the configuration process for deploying Airplay.

## Cisco Room Bar now has support for 1 Cisco Microphone Pro

Cisco Room Bar now supports one Cisco Microphone Pro. AV Integrator Option is not required.

## Home screen web widgets

Now, you have the option to enable a compact web view that won't take over your entire screen like a regular web view. This is especially useful for displaying the web app in the form of a small card, for example, providing information about the environment or meeting room directly on your device's main screen next to the clock. It's important to remember that the device only renders the web app through an external URL and you can only have one Web Widget enabled on the home screen. 

<img src="/doc/images/releases/webwidget.png" style="border: none; height: 300px; width: auto; margin-left: 70px;">

You will find an option to configure the web widget in the UI Extensions editor on the device's web interface. 

The device must have Web Engine enabled for this feature to work. 

Note: The home screen web widget is displayed on the screen, not on peripherals like the Cisco Room Navigator.

## Presenter and Audience Room Mode

Presenter and Audience is a new Room Mode that is essentially a combination of Briefing Room and Classroom mode and will eventually replace these modes. The Briefing Room and Classroom modes are still there together with the Presenter and Audience for the lifespan of RoomOS 11.x. Briefing Room and Classroom modes are planned to be decommissioned with the release of RoomOS 12 in 2024.

The main difference between Classroom and Briefing Room is the number of screens it supports. Briefing Room only offered support for three screens while Classroom offered more flexibility for two and three screens. 

Presenter and Audience is essentially the same as both Briefing Room and Classroom mode combined but with a few essential updates. 

In previous Classroom or Briefing Room configurations, we offered modes like Local Presenter, Remote Presenter, and Discussion to cater to various presentation scenarios. However, these modes often lacked sufficient control. For example, selecting 'Remote Presenter' could inadvertently switch to 'Local Presenter' if someone entered a specific area, leading to a less than ideal experience.

To address this, we've introduced a 'manual mode' in our Presenter and Audience mode. Now, when you select a mode on the touch panel, it locks in until you decide to change it. For those who prefer the previous settings, selecting 'Auto' will retain the original automatic switching functionality.

Additionally, we've refined the modes available. 'Discussion' mode has been replaced with 'Hybrid Presenter'—a versatile new option that merges 'Local Presenter' with 'Remote Presenter.' This allows for a dynamic presentation where you can share the stage with a remote participant displayed on the screen.

We also added a new tool for Presenter and Audience in the device settings Issues and Diagnostics > Presenter & Audience Diagnostics. In this tool you can configure the microphone orientation for the connected microphones to be either "Audience" or "Stage". In addition you can see the live volume from the stage and audience including intelligent voice detection probability and more.

Please refer to the setup documentation for more information. [Setup documentation](https://help.webex.com/nlio4t1/) - will be available shortly after release.

## Meeting Zone Configuration

The "Meeting Zone" feature allows you to customize the area that your conference device monitors during meetings. To set it up, go to the device settings on the touch panel and navigate to the "Meeting Zone" settings. Here, you'll choose whether your meeting area is round or square. Based on your selection, you'll get a preset layout that you can adjust to define the exact meeting space.

This function is particularly useful for rooms with glass walls where people passing by could unintentionally be counted as participants or in any sense, become an unintentional "focus". By configuring the "Meeting Zone", you can prevent this by specifying which areas are included in the meeting boundary. Individuals outside this zone won't affect the people count or disrupt your device intelligence in any way.

## Enable Web Views to trust the devices own self-signed certificate

This will allow the device to load a web view of it's own web interface while using a self-signed certificate. It will also allow web apps that is loaded on the device to connect to the xAPI using WebSockets, for example, the 'jsxapi' module and interact with the xAPI directly. 

It is important to note that this setting is only for the device's own self-signed certificate and will not work as a bypass for other websites. 

This feature is disabled by default, [xConfiguration WebEngine Features AllowDeviceCertificate](https://roomos.cisco.com/xapi/Configuration.WebEngine.Features.AllowDeviceCertificate/).

## Standalone Room Navigator for on-premises management

You can now choose to use the Cisco Room Navigator as a standalone device without having to connect it to a codec or register it anywhere. 

To set it up, the Cisco Room Navigator must be running RoomOS 11.9.x and be in a factory reset state. Follow the wizard on the Room Navigator and select "Setup as Standalone". In this mode, you will be prompted to setup a username and password, which can be used to access the Room Navigator Web Interface or xAPI. 

Important: In standalone mode, the Room Navigator is only supported with Persistent Web App mode. This means you'll need to run a web app on the device to use it with any of your custom setups.

In this scenario, it is not possible to register the Room Navigator to a Cisco management system. The responsibility of managing the device, configurations, firmware, and web apps lies with the user or administrator.

The Room Navigator is upgraded the same way as any Room Device using the web interface. You can also connect the Room Navigator to a codec that is running supported software as this will automatically upgrade the Cisco Room Navigator to match the software version.

## Infrastructure mode in Miracast®

Infrastructure mode or MS-MICE (1), [xConfiguration Video Input Miracast Transport](https://roomos.cisco.com/xapi/Configuration.Video.Input.Miracast.Transport/), will allow you to use the existing network to project content from Windows clients. The projecting device (i.e. laptop) must be on the same network as the Room Device when "Infrastructure" is enabled as transport. You can use the existing Wi-Fi network or Ethernet. 

Guest sharing (using Wi-Fi Direct will be disabled in this mode). This can also prevent the devices using Wi-Fi Direct to interfere with the existing Wi-Fi network. 

Please read [this document](https://help.webex.com/en-us/article/w60modb/Configure-wireless-sharing-with-Miracast%C2%AE) for a more detailed overview of this feature.

# Release summary for RoomOS 11.5 

## Notes and warnings for this software release

RoomOS 11.5 enables support for Cisco Room Panorama, Room 70 Panorama and Room USB. RoomOS 11.1 did not have support for these devices. The list of limitations in the RoomOS 11.1 section has been resolved in this release. 

### Default configuration changes

[xConfiguration SIP ListenPort](https://roomos.cisco.com/xapi/Configuration.SIP.ListenPort/) now has "Off" as its default value. 
This may impact your setup if you are not registered to any service and are using the device for direct calling and have not explicitly set the configuration to "On". The solution is to turn it to "On" again after you have upgraded the device. 

Note: Configurations only follow the default value if the current configuration is default and not explicitly set to a value. For example, if the default value is "On" and you configure the configuration to "On" you have explicitly set the configuration to "On" and this particular configuration will no longer follow default value changes on upgrade. 

### Changes to how Proxy Auto-Configuration (PAC) works

We have made som changes to how PAC matching works for pacmanager in RoomOS software. We are changing the shExpMatch function to use a matching similar to what browsers use. This means that RoomOS will work with the same PAC file matches as other web clients in the network. 

<font color='red'><b>PAC files specifically written for RoomOS may need to be updated to keep working as intended!</b></font>

Note: RoomOS 11 currently do not have support for FairPlay (DRM) - which means you cannot playback copy protected content at this time

<a name='11124-4'></a>

## Native Zoom button and in-call controls

In previous versions it have been possible to join Zoom meetings as these are SIP calls. We have seen the need for a simpler way to join these meetings and are now introducing a native Zoom button that will allow you to type in the Zoom meeting ID and a passphrase for joining the meeting. 

You could create a similar user interface for joining Zoom meetings in the past using a combination of macros and UI Extensions but is now available as a native implementation in RoomOS 11. The button can be enabled using the following configuration: 

[xConfiguration UserInterface Features Call JoinZoom](https://roomos.cisco.com/xapi/Configuration.UserInterface.Features.Call.JoinZoom/)

This button is hidden by default and must be enabled, by using the above command from xAPI or setting the config from the web interface.

Once you have joined the meeting you will now also see specific Zoom in-call controls. The submenus of these controls (Layout, Host options, Participants and More) makes it easier to perform distinct actions without memorizing DTMF sequences, for example when changing layout. 

Note: The in-call controls will be displayed even though you are not the host. The controls can be pressed but will not have any effect if you are not the host. 

Note: Currently there is no "admit all" button in the participant list

When a Zoom meeting is booked on the device it will be displayed as a Zoom meeting with OBTP. 

To change the default Zoom domain you can use the following configuration:

[xConfiguration Zoom DefaultDomain](https://roomos.cisco.com/xapi/Configuration.Zoom.DefaultDomain/)

**Supported products**<br>
All products<br>
Note: Board and Desk UI do not have support for the Zoom in-call controls yet (Resolved in 11.5.2)

<a name='11124-5'></a>

## New whiteboard version with improved usability

A new version of the whiteboard is implemented in RoomOS 11. This version introduces new tools and operations. 

Some of the new tools include: 

* New shapes tool
    * Create new shapes (squares, triangles or circles) with options for resizing the shapes and move them around
	* Select the shape to change color of the shape, make it transparent or delete the shape
* New selection tool
    * Drag your finger or pen over the board to select objects, drawings or sticky notes to move them to other locations
	* When selected a delete button will appear. When pressed all the selected objects will be deleted
* New eraser tool
    * In previous versions you would have to delete each pixel, the new version will delete the whole stroke object
* Change name of the whiteboard
	* By selecting the name of the whiteboard in the top left corner you will be able to name the whiteboard
* Browse your current whiteboards
	* Select the file icon in the bottom left corner to bring up the whiteboard browser 
	* Select saved whiteboards to continue working on previous whiteboards
* Magic pen tool
	* The whiteboard can recognize basic shapes like, square, circles, triangles, rectangles, arrows and curved lines as you draw them and will straighten edges and close small gaps in the outline for you.

<a name='11124-6'></a>

## Persistent camera and microphone access for Web View and WebRTC meetings

In previous version you had to grant camera and microphone access each time you accessed a web app that required the use of microphone or camera, for example in a WebRTC call. 

With this feature you can persistently add hostnames to a list where microphone and/or camera access should be allowed by default. This has to be performed from the xAPI using the following commands: 

```
xCommand WebEngine MediaAccess Add
Device(r)[2]: <Camera, Microphone>
Hostname(r): <S: 0, 1024>
xCommand WebEngine MediaAccess List
xCommand WebEngine MediaAccess Remove
Id(r): <0..65534>
xCommand WebEngine MediaAccess RemoveAll
```

For example, if you use a specific service for WebRTC calls you can add the host to the list to allow microphone and / or camera access when this host is accessed. 

```
xCommand WebEngine MediaAccess Add Device: Camera Device: Microphone Hostname: videoservice.domain.com
```

## Support for Cisco Table Microphone Pro for Cisco Codec Pro, Codec EQ and Room 70 G2

Cisco Table Microphone Pro is a multi-directional digital Ethernet microphone (audio over IP). In previous releases, this microphone was only supported by Cisco Room Panorama and Room 70 Panorama. We have now added support for Cisco Codec EQ, Codec Pro and Room 70 G2 from RoomOS 11.1.2.4

**Supported products**<br>
All products

## Other 

Other minor changes to note.

<a name='av-integrator-key'></a>

## AV Integrator Option key 

A new option key that unlocks the Audio Console for products that have this option, i.e. Room Kit EQ.

<a name='default-passphrase'></a>

## Default passphrase policy updated

While the default passphrase remains unchanged, the device will not allow calling until a passphrase has been set on the device. This means that we now require a passphrase to be set on the device in order to unlock the full functionality of the device. This will be noted in a warning displayed on the screen.

# Software upgrade and downgrade

## Upgrading software on a Cisco Room Device 

Before performing an upgrade or downgrade to a given version you should verify the compatibility level on the device and confirm the minimum version that is supported on your product. You can find a [compatibility matrix](#cisco-room-series-software-compatibility-matrix) in this document for reference.

Due to the deprecations of the xx.k3.cop.sgn files for new releases, you are required to upgrade to RoomOS 10.15.x or later in order to upgrade to RoomOS 11 when using other upgrade methods. We are now only releasing xx.k4.cop.sha512 files going forward with RoomOS 11 and also lower maintenance releases. Support for upgrading devices using the cop files with the new signature from the codec itself was introduced with RoomOS 10.15.x. 

The reason for this requirement is that the device is unable to unpack the new cop files on earlier versions because it incorrectly assumes that the signature of the package is invalid. 

This limitation applies when upgrading using TMS, xAPI (SSH) or the codec web interface - because the codec will attempt to unpack the cop files in these scenarios. It does not apply when using UCM, because UCM unpacks the xx.k4.cop.sha512 before its applied to the codec. 

To avoid issues during upgrade, either upgrade using UCM or make sure the devices you are about to upgrade is running RoomOS 10.15.x or above. UCM 11.5 or higher with the latest dev pack installed is highly recommended.

The "All products" cop file (super cop) must only be installed to a Unified CM. This package provides software to all supported video models and peripherals, so you only have to install one cop file if you have multiple products. 

*** Contains the MTR module, you can upgrade using this package in order to get the option to select between RoomOS and MTR

**NOTE: Upgrading from the device web interface using xx.k4.cop.sha512 files is supported from RoomOS 10.15.x and above**

**WARNING: Do not delete ".pkg" files that are stated to be "Not in use" on Unified CM. The devices are pointed to a loads file that tells it what package to use for the different peripherals. UCM is not aware that the ".pkg" is in use. By deleting peripheral or device software the device will fail to upgrade or fail to upgrade its peripherals.**

### Software integrity verification after download

To verify the integrity of the software image you have downloaded from cisco.com, you can calculate a SHA512 checksum and verify that it matches with the one listed on the software download page. To find the checksum, hover the mouse pointer over the software image you have downloaded. 
 
At the bottom you find the SHA512 checksum, if you do not see the whole checksum you can expand it by pressing the "..." at the end. 
To calculate a SHA512 checksum on your local desktop please see below.

#### SHA512 checksum calculation command examples	

**Microsoft Windows**

Open a command line window and type the following command:
```
> certutil.exe -hashfile filename.k4.cop.sha512 SHA512
```

**macOS**	

Open a terminal window and type the following command:
```
$ shasum -a 512 filename.k4.cop.sha512
```

**Linux**	

Open a terminal window and type the following command:
```
$ sha512sum filename.k4.cop.sha512
Or
$ shasum -a 512 filename.k4.cop.sha512
```

If the SHA512 checksum matches, there is a high level of certainty that no one has tampered with the software image or the image has not been corrupted during download. 

If the SHA512 checksum does not match, we advise you to not attempt upgrading any systems with the software image. Download the software again and verify the SHA512 checksum again. If there is a constant mismatch, please open a case with the Cisco Technical Assistance Center.

Note:
You should always use the “.cop” file when upgrading the devices listed above. Upgrading using “.pkg” on these devices will leave the device unable to upgrade the peripherals and you may experience error messages regarding software mismatch after upgrade. Such issues could happen if you used the “.pkg” extension when upgrading the device from UCM or in other ways. To resolve this, upgrade the software again using the “.cop” file. Cisco only release “.cop” files for RoomOS 11 and above. 

**Upgrade using the web interface**

Access the web interface of the device on: 

`https://codecIP/web/software`

Upload the correct software package by following the instructions on the web page. The upgrade will start, and the device will reboot with the new software. 

**If you are on an older software version like CE9.15 or below, please refer to the [RoomOS 10 release note](https://roomos.cisco.com/print/WhatsNew/ReleaseNotesRoomOS_10) for further instructions before proceeding with the upgrade to RoomOS 11** 

**Upgrade using UCM**

Install the appropriate “xx.k4.cop.sha512” file containing the software for the device platform you wish to upgrade according to the cop installation process on UCM. 

Go into the device default loads on the UCM administration page and make sure the platform has populated the correct filename. 

For Cisco Room devices s53200 and s53300, the load file name should not contain any extension at all, for example:

Platform Specific packages:<br>
s53200ce11_X_X_X.pkg (**wrong**)<br>
s53200ce11_X_X_X (**correct**)

All products (containing all software versions for all products):<br>
ce11_X_X_X (**correct**)

**Upgrade using TMS**

Upload the software to TMS according to the TMS instructions of software upgrade. 

Note: There is a known limitation with older TMS versions. The affected versions do not accept the sha512 extension of the RoomOS software. Please upgrade to the latest TMS software version or refer to the TMS documentation for information about the minimum version you need to use.

Also note that devices must be running RoomOS 10.15.x or above in order to do a successful upgrade to RoomOS 11 via TMS.

**Upgrade using the xAPI**
 
If none of the above methods are applicable, you can use an existing HTTP server or setup a HTTP server that is reachable by the device(s) you want to upgrade. 

Log into the xAPI CLI using SSH or Serial. Type the following command to initiate the upgrade:

```
xCommand SystemUnit SoftwareUpgrade URL: http(s)://yourHTTPserver/path/to/file
xCommand SystemUnit SoftwareUpgrade URL: http(s)://yourUCMserver:6970/file
xCommand SystemUnit SoftwareUpgrade URL: http(s)://yourTMSserver/public/path/to/file
```

/path/to/file is replaced with the location of the xx.k4.cop.sha512 file. 

The device will download the software package and upgrade without warning. If you want the user to be warned and postpone the upgrade, add the parameter: `“Forced: False”` to the command as the default is `“Forced: True”`.

If you are upgrading to RoomOS 11 using this method, please make sure the device is running RoomOS 10.15.x or above. 

### Downgrading

Downgrading is performed the same way as described above, using a software version lower than the one you are currently running. Not all products are compatible with all software versions. Please verify the minimum software version in the [compatibility matrix](#cisco-room-series-software-compatibility-matrix) before downgrading or upgrading your product. 

If you are planning to downgrade to a version lower than the one you are currently on, make sure your compatibility level is mentioned in the release note of that version with a minimum version. For example downgrading from RoomOS 11 to RoomOS 10. If the compatibility level of your device is listed with a version of RoomOS 10, then it will be supported from that version. If the number is not mentioned with a version of RoomOS 10 but only RoomOS 11, then the device cannot be downgraded. Check the respective release note of the version you are downgrading to as we do not mention previous version compatibility levels in newer versions of the release notes. 

<a name="deferral-notes"></a>

## Software deferral policy 

A software version is deferred when we find critical issues within the software. This is to prevent users from downloading and installing affected software versions. Replacement software will always be in place before a software version is deferred.

Older software versions will be deferred on a regular basis from the download section on https://www.cisco.com to avoid providing potential vulnerable software after security fixes. As a general rule you will be able to download the latest release and the version before. Older software versions will be removed from cisco.com regularly. Cisco always recommend using the latest available software. 

**Example:**

**RoomOS 10.X.Y.z = Major.Minor.Patch.Buildnumber**

For RoomOS versions that have been provided by the Webex cloud, "Y" will always be 1 (11.X.**1**.z) while a RoomOS version released to cisco.com the same number will always be higher than 1 and will increment by one for each patch release. 

If for example, RoomOS 11.1.2.x and RoomOS 11.3.2.x is released and RoomOS 11.6.2.x becomes available. RoomOS 11.1.2.x may be removed as part of the deferral policy for end of support. A minor software version is typically supported for two release cycles (6-9 months).

Cisco supports the latest minor release (i.e. RoomOS 11.3.1.x) and the previous minor release (i.e. RoomOS 11.1.2.x) per product as a general rule. 

Exceptions are made if supported hardware or particular feature deployments are depending on a major release. Deferral of older maintenance releases still applies.

## Known limitations and advisories for RoomOS 11

### Resource consumption

**Extended Logging**		

Extended logging is a troubleshooting feature and will consume a high amount of resources when enabled. Enabling extended logging can generate unexpected behavior in production calls and in rare cases, cause the device to crash due to resource consumption. This feature should therefore only be enabled in short periods if higher data collection is required when reproducing issues for example, in cooperation with Cisco TAC. 

**Note on IP Filtering Capabilities**	

Our devices supports IP filtering for SSH, HTTP and HTTPS in order to provide enhanced admin access control. However, other services such as SIP and H.323, do not currently support IP filtering. While this has always been the case, we recommend that customers deploy these services within secure network environments and use external security controls as needed to mitigate potential exposure to denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.

**Network Congestion**	

Anything that degrades network performance can affect voice and video quality and, in some cases, can cause a call to drop. Sources of network degradation can include, but are not limited to, the following activities:

* Administrative tasks such as an internal port scan or security scan
* Attacks that occur on your network, such as a denial-of-service attack

To reduce or eliminate any adverse effects to conferences, schedule any administrative network tasks during a time when the Cisco Room Device is not being used, or exclude the Cisco Room systems from the testing.

### Wi-Fi Connection 

Due to compliance regulations, it is required to enable 802.11d in access points for the product to operate properly within 5725 MHz – 5875 MHz. As Wi-Fi connections can be used as a flexible option, an Ethernet connection is always preferred for high performance.

**WPA-EAP**<br>
There is currently no diagnostic message for expired certificates

**CA Certificates**<br>
CA certificates must be uploaded per endpoint, it is possible to use the xAPI to perform manual or automated mass-distribution of certificates to devices. Please also note that the endpoint must be connected to a wired or WPA2-PSK wireless network in order to upload a certificate before attempting to connect to a WPA-EAP enabled network that requires a CA certificate. 

Devices flagged with "NR" (No Radio) do not have Wi-Fi capability. 

**Web Engine**<br>

We only support resolutions of 1080p and above. Web engine is not capable of rendering web views in full screen when using 720p resolutions. 
720p resolution is not supported with our devices, please use 1080p minimum. 

**Platform sanity issues (MIC certificates)**<br>

Related to bug CSCwf86271. 

Crash reported in logs: 
platform-sanity: migration-tool.service failed to run, transition needed
Diagnostics provides this error message: platform-sanity: migration-tool.service failed to run, transition needed

Solution: 
Downgrade to 10.19 (latest available), which will do this conversion automatically. Then upgrade back up to 11.x.

**Network paired Cisco Touch 10 / Navigator not supported when the video system is connected through Wi-Fi**<br>
Even though this connectivity works, you may end up in cumbersome scenarios if the Wi-Fi connectivity is lost for any reason, for example when the Wi-Fi password is changed. In order to reconfigure the Wi-Fi connection, you need to setup a direct pairing between the video system and the Touch 10 / Navigator before reconnecting the Cisco Touch 10 / Navigator. When the video system is using Wi-Fi connectivity Cisco recommends that you have the Touch 10 directly paired with the video system.  

### Cisco Webex and Cisco Webex Edge for Devices 

**Pairing Cisco Touch 10 or Room Navigator**<br>
To activate a device on Webex with a LAN paired Cisco Touch 10 or Cisco Room Navigator panel, you should pair the touch device before you activate the system on Webex. 

In case you have registered the device to Webex and locked the device user accounts, you can initiate pin pairing of the touch panel fro Control Hub if the device is running RoomOS 10.11 or above.

We always recommend that you upgrade to the latest available RoomOS version before activating your device on Webex. 

**Encryption is required to activate a Room Device on Webex**<br>
A Room Device with support for encryption is required to activate the device on Webex and Webex Edge for Devices. Cisco Room Devices with the K7 flag in the device part number (can be found in the xAPI by using xStatus), do not have support for encryption and cannot be registered or linked to Webex. Encryption support for Cisco Room Devices are determined by hardware and are not using encryption option keys. 

If the device do not have the encryption option, then the device is a K7 device. Devices flagged with K9 in the part number have support for encryption. 

You can check if the device have the encryption option key from the web interface under "option keys". This key can neither be added or removed as it is based on the hardware model you have with K7 (no crypto) or K9 (crypto) notation. 
 
### Peripherals

**Cisco Touch 10**<br>

An area may appear dead on the Cisco Touch 10 controller’s screen if this area has been touched during start-up of the panel. In the start-up phase, a touch calibration process takes place. If something is in contact with the touch panel at this time, this area may lose its function until the Touch 10 has been restarted. Do not touch the touch panel during boot to avoid this.

To explain what these numbers mean, let’s take for example the "authenticated" method:<br>
If you send 30 authenticated HTTP requests at once, it will take minimum 30 seconds before you get a response to the last request. If you send 31 requests, assuming all is coming in at the same time, the 31st request will get a http 503 response.

This is no longer the case, and we have removed all CE9 software for these products and we will not release anything from CE9 to the new products. Some customers may still be running old and unsupported software. We recommend that the software is upgraded to RoomOS 10.15.x or above before upgrading to RoomOS 11. 

For Room Kit, Room Kit Mini, Codec Plus, Room 55, Room70 G1 :

Upgrading to RoomOS 11 from CE9.14.4 and below may result in error “Hardware or Operating System Failure”, which can only be fixed by downgrading to RoomOS 10.15.2 software or above, and then upgrade back to RoomOS 11.

Always verify the compatibility level when upgrading and downgrading devices.

## Camera firmware and support

Note: The camera firmware has parity with the version installed on the Room Device. Camera software for Cisco Quad Camera, Cisco TelePresence Precision 60 and Cisco TelePresence SpeakerTrack 60 will automatically be updated when the Room Device is upgraded or downgraded. The camera firmware should share the same hash as the current software installed on the Room Device.

**Third party cameras**

Third-party and older cameras may work with our Integration Room Devices but this is not tested and functionality cannot be guaranteed. TAC support may be rejected or limited. 

## Cisco collaboration certification program

Cisco collaboration devices partner ecosystem is built on our certification program to ensure that customers get the best experience out of their Cisco collaboration devices and make integration as seamless as possible when integrating with third-party technology.

[For more information, click here](https://help.webex.com/en-us/article/7sw4gab/Cisco-collaboration-devices-certification-program)

**HDMI Cable quality**<br>
Cisco recommends use of high-quality HDMI 2.0 certified cables. Lower quality cables may work but may also have an impact on the image quality. 

If you experience problems and do not have access to high quality cables, try using shorter HDMI cables. 

## xAPI Changes 
We recommend endpoint configuration through the web interface and not from the xAPI command line.

The admin user have access to only a subset of relevant commands and configuration from the xAPI. The admin user can fully manage the system from the web interface where all the configurations are available. The "remotesupport" user have access to the full list of xAPI commands when utilized (requires TAC engagement). 

Specific xAPI changes are not published in the release notes. Please refer to the Cisco API Reference Guides for the integrator products at the following locations:

Cisco Room Series: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/collaboration-endpoints/spark-room-kit-series/products-command-reference-list.html

Cisco Boards: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/collaboration-endpoints/spark-board/products-command-reference-list.html

Please also visit https://roomos.cisco.com for a great overview of the xAPI and other resources. 

## Hardware revision and software dependencies

Due to occasional updates to hardware components, there can be constraints on running older software on newly manufactured Room Devices.

To identify a Room Device compatibility level, you can access the web interface of the Room Device and click on Settings > Statuses. Scroll down to the compatibility level on this page. The below tables can be used to identify software constraints based on the compatibility level of your endpoint.  
Downgrading to an unsupported software version will fail. 
The latest software release is backward compatible with previous hardware revisions.

Note: When "all" is mentioned as the minimum version it is referring to all software versions of RoomOS 10 that is or has been released on https://www.cisco.com.

**Notes for Cisco Quad Camera**

Systems that support Quad Camera are Cisco Codec Pro, Codec Plus, Room 70 and Room 70 G2 (single / dual).
Hardware revisions of the Quad Camera can be identified using xStatus. 

**Example:**
```
xStatus: Peripherals ConnectedDevice XXXX HardwareInfo: "73-100746-1".
```
 
**Notes for Cisco TelePresence Precision 60**

Systems that support Cisco TelePresence Precision 60 with RoomOS 10 is Cisco Codec Pro, Codec Plus, Room 70 and Room 70 G2 (single / dual).

Note: Room 70 Panorama do NOT support the Precision 60 camera

New hardware revisions of the Cisco TelePresence Precision 60 camera are identified by production date printed on a sticker underneath the base. If there no sticker is present and you still see an error message on screen about the camera not being compatible with the current software version, please upgrade the room device to the latest software. 

**Notes for Cisco PTZ 4K camera**

The camera setup switch is for selecting the video signal format to be "output" from the HDMI OUT terminal. This should always be set to 6 in order to be controlled by the Room Device. 

Please take note that the camera MAC address is being used as the serial number to identify and address the camera on the Room Device. The codec does not receive the serial number information from this camera. To find the actual serial number of the camera, please refer to the label located beneath the physical unit.

For more information about the Webex PTZ 4K Camera, please [follow this link](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/collateral/collaboration-endpoints/collaboration-peripherals/webex-ptz-4k-camera-ds.html).
