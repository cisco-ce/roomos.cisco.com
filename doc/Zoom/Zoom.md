# Zoom for Cisco Rooms - Beta

We are introducing an enhanced interoperability with Zoom. This enables users to join Zoom Meetings on their trusted Cisco devices with the familiar Zoom Meetings UI, delivering a seamless experience.

**External Beta enrollment is expected in September, 2025.** 

Users can join Zoom Meetings by pressing the green Join button for scheduled meetings (if Hybrid Calendar is enabled) or by selecting the Zoom Meetings app on the Cisco device to enter a Meeting ID. This launches the Zoom Meetings application on the device. Once the meeting concludes, the device automatically returns to the Cisco Rooms home screen.

Signed-in devices will also be able to start an instant meeting.
