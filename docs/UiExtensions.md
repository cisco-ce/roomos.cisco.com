# User Interface Extensions

User Interface Extensions allow you to create new panels and action buttons on the Webex Devices to create custom behaviour. This can be used to simplify the workflow, automate tasks on the video device or control entirely different devices in the room, such as lights, blinds, air condition, etc.

The UI extensions is a pure user interface without any control logic built-in. When the user interacts with the UI elements, events are generated that you as a developer can listen and react to, either with macros or external integrations using eg JSXAPI. This means that you can create a UI that does anything you want, from controlling the lights in the meeting room to sending a message when more than a certain number of people have been detected in an office, to starting your coffee machine.

For technical details, see the [Customization guide](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/collaboration-endpoints/telepresence-quick-set-series/products-installation-and-configuration-guides-list.html).

The UI Extensions editor is available on the local web interface on each device, but you can also try the editor here and export your configuration, if you wish:
