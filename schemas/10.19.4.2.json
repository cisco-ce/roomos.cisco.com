Refer to the Cameras SpeakerTrack TrackingMode setting for different switching modes.","read":["Admin","Integrator","User"],"role":["Admin","Integrator"],"valuespace":{"Values":["Auto","Off"],"type":"Literal"}},"id":41500,"normPath":"Cameras SpeakerTrack Mode","path":"Cameras SpeakerTrack Mode","products":["barents","svea"],"type":"Configuration"},{"attributes":{"access":"public-api","backend":"any","default":"Auto","read":["Admin","Integrator","User"],"role":["Admin","Integrator"],"valuespace":{"Values":["Auto","Conservative"],"type":"Literal"},"description":"This setting applies only when using a SpeakerTrack 60 camera, and when Cameras SpeakerTrack Mode is set to Auto.

Example 1: - UserManagement LDAP Mode: On - UserManagement LDAP Address: \"192.0.2.20\" - UserManagement LDAP BaseDN: \"DC=company, DC=com\" - UserManagement LDAP Admin Group: \"CN=admin group, OU=company groups, DC=company, DC=com\" Example 2: - UserManagement LDAP Mode: On - UserManagement LDAP Address: \"192.0.2.20\" - UserManagement LDAP BaseDN: \"DC=company, DC=com\" - UserManagement LDAP Admin Filter: \"(|(memberof=CN=admin group, OU=company groups, DC=company, DC=com)(sAMAccountName=username))\"","read":["Admin","User"],"role":["Admin"],"valuespace":{"Values":["Off","On"],"type":"Literal"}},"id":33808,"normPath":"UserManagement LDAP Mode","path":"UserManagement LDAP Mode","products":["bandai","barents","barents_70d","barents_70i","barents_70s","barents_82i","baymax","darling_10_55","darling_10_70","darling_15_55","darling_15_70","darling_15_85","davinci","havella","helix_55","helix_75","hopen","octavio","polaris","polaris_light","spitsbergen","svea","svea_55d","svea_70d","svea_70s"],"type":"Configuration"},{"attributes":{"access":"public-api","backend":"onprem","default":"","description":"Set the IP address or hostname of the LDAP server.","read":["Admin","User"],"role":["Admin"],"valuespace":{"MaxLength":"255","MinLength":"0","type":"String"}},"id":27034,"normPath":"UserManagement LDAP Server Address","path":"UserManagement LDAP Server Address","products":["bandai","barents","barents_70d","barents_70i","barents_70s","barents_82i","baymax","darling_10_55","darling_10_70","darling_15_55","darling_15_70","darling_15_85","davinci","havella","helix_55","helix_75","hopen","octavio","polaris","polaris_light","spitsbergen","svea","svea_55d","svea_70d","svea_70s"],"type":"Configuration"},{"attributes":{"access":"public-api","backend":"onprem","default":"0","description":"Set the port to connect to the LDAP server on.
