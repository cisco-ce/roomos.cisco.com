A typical use case it to measure the delay in a TV connected to the video device via the HDMI connector. If the delay in a TV is too high, the real-time experience of a video call will be substantially degraded. If the delay is more than 50 ms we recommend the user to find a TV setting that has shorter delay. Typical TV settings that can reduce the delay are: Gaming Mode and PC Mode. This command will measure the delay between output and input (microphone). This means that if you are using an external acoustic echo canceller or audio mixer, this command will also measure the delay of these devices.",

We allow up to 4 channels per input, and the gain is set separately for each channel. The gain should be adjusted to suit the output level of the connected audio source. The gain can be tuned in steps of 1 dB. If the gain is set too high, the audio signal will be clipped. If the gain is set too low, the audio signal-to-noise ratio will be degraded; however, this is usually preferable to clipping. Note that unprocessed speech signals typically contain significant level variations, making it very important to allow for sufficient signal headroom.",

If the gain is set too high, the audio signal will be clipped. If the gain is set too low, the audio signal-to-noise ratio will be degraded; however, this is usually preferable to clipping. Note that unprocessed speech signals typically contain significant level variations, making it very important to allow for sufficient signal headroom. The maximum input level with 0 dB gain depends on the product: -18 dBu (Room Bar, Room Kit, Codec Plus, Room 55, Room 70, Room 55 Dual), 24 dBu (Codec Pro, Room 70 G2). Example: If your microphone has a maximum output level of -44 dBu, and it is connected to a Codec Pro, then you should set the gain to 24 dBu - (-44 dBu) = 68 dB.",

If the requested volume value is outside this range, the closest allowed value will be used. The Audio USB VolumeControl Capture Value status always returns the actual gain applied. Note that the USB device may apply a gain as default. Since the Audio USB VolumeControl Capture Value status always returns the actual gain applied, you may want to check this status before you decide on which gain to request.

This is the gain that the video device requests the USB capture device to apply after receiving the audio signal from the video device. The actual range that the USB device offers can be found in the Audio USB VolumeControl Playback Max and Audio USB VolumeControl Playback Min statuses. If the requested volume value is outside this range, the closest allowed value will be used. The Audio USB VolumeControl Playback Value status always returns the actual gain applied. Note that the USB device may apply a gain as default. Since the Audio USB VolumeControl Playback Value status always returns the actual gain applied, you may want to check this status before you decide on which gain to request. Example: If you want to request a 6 dB increase to the current level, and the default gain already applied by the USB device is 42 dB, you must set the Audio USB VolumeControl Playback Value setting to 48, that is 42+6 dB.",

You should use the Cameras Camera AssignedSerialNumber setting to cater for configurations where the video device does not receive EDID information from multiple cameras. This setting allows you to manually assign a camera ID to a camera by associating the camera ID with the camera's serial number. The setting is persistent until the video device is factory reset.

The format is a list of polygons separated by semicolons. Each polygon is defined by 3 or more coordinate pairs, separated by commas. The coordinates are spherical and expressed in hundredths of degrees. For example, \"0,0\" would indicate a ray pointing straight out of the camera. \"100,100\" would indicate a ray pointing one degree to the left and one degree up from the camera. For a motorized camera, the coordinate system is relative to the neutral position of the camera, and does not change when the camera moves. For multi camera setups it is useful to note that the exclusion zones are defined per camera. Example: \"1000,500, 500,500, 500,-500, 1000,500; -2000,-1000, -2500,-1000, -2500,-1500, -2000,-1500\" This defines two exclusion zones: - The first is from (10°,5°) to (5°,-5°). - The second is from (-20°,-10°) to (-25°,-15°)",

You should use the Cameras Camera AssignedSerialNumber setting to cater for configurations where the video device does not receive EDID information from multiple cameras. This setting allows you to manually assign a camera ID to a camera by associating the camera ID with the camera's serial number. The setting is persistent until the video device is factory reset.

This means that a camera may get a new camera ID when the video device is restarted. You should use the Cameras Camera AssignedSerialNumber setting to cater for configurations where the video device does not receive EDID information from multiple cameras. This setting allows you to manually assign a camera ID to a camera by associating the camera ID with the camera's serial number. The setting is persistent until the video device is factory reset.

        "description": "When set, this configuration instructs the Multi Camera Director to ignore faces that appear in selected areas of a camera's field of view. The format is a list of polygons separated by semicolons. Each polygon is defined by 3 or more coordinate pairs, separated by commas. The coordinates are spherical and expressed in hundredths of degrees. For example, \"0,0\" would indicate a ray pointing straight out of the camera. \"100,100\" would indicate a ray pointing one degree to the left and one degree up from the camera. For a motorized camera, the coordinate system is relative to the neutral position of the camera, and does not change when the camera moves. For multi camera setups it is useful to note that the exclusion zones are defined per camera. Example: \"1000,500, 500,500, 500,-500, 1000,500; -2000,-1000, -2500,-1000, -2500,-1500, -2000,-1500\" This defines two exclusion zones: - The first is from (10°,5°) to (5°,-5°). - The second is from (-20°,-10°) to (-25°,-15°)",

This means that a camera may get a new camera ID when the video device is restarted. You should use the Cameras Camera AssignedSerialNumber setting to cater for configurations where the video device does not receive EDID information from multiple cameras. This setting allows you to manually assign a camera ID to a camera by associating the camera ID with the camera's serial number. The setting is persistent until the video device is factory reset.

The format is a list of polygons separated by semicolons. Each polygon is defined by 3 or more coordinate pairs, separated by commas. The coordinates are spherical and expressed in hundredths of degrees. For example, \"0,0\" would indicate a ray pointing straight out of the camera. \"100,100\" would indicate a ray pointing one degree to the left and one degree up from the camera. For a motorized camera, the coordinate system is relative to the neutral position of the camera, and does not change when the camera moves. For multi camera setups it is useful to note that the exclusion zones are defined per camera. Example: \"1000,500, 500,500, 500,-500, 1000,500; -2000,-1000, -2500,-1000, -2500,-1500, -2000,-1500\" This defines two exclusion zones: - The first is from (10°,5°) to (5°,-5°). - The second is from (-20°,-10°) to (-25°,-15°)",

Both the built-in MultiSite feature, which relies only on local resources, and different solutions based on centralized infrastructure (multipoint control units – MCUs) are available. The MultiSite feature is an upgrade option and is only available on devices where the MultiSite option key is installed. If registered to a Cisco TelePresence Video Communication Server (VCS), the device can use MultiSite when calling other video devices. If registered to a Cisco Unified Communications Manager (CUCM), the device can use either a CUCM conference bridge or the device's own built-in MultiSite feature. Which option to use, is set up by CUCM. In either case, multiparty conferences may be set up via an MCU if you call an MCU that allows devices to add participants to a conference (Direct Remote Add).",

        "description": "This setting is part of the graceful deprecation strategy of decommissioning the old macro runtime environment that was using Duktape as runtime engine. This runtime engine was also supporting ECMA Script 2009 style Javascript code standard and was under the hood using a transpiler library called Bable. The runtime engine going forward is QuickJS and supports only ECMA Script 2015/2020 coding standard. QuickJS is the default runtime engine in this software release (use the Macros QuickJS setting to change runtime engine if needed). However, the Bable transpiler is still being used. There are substantial benefits of QuickJS both regarding speed and features that will be fully unlocked when also the Bable transpiler is disabled. However, as there are some older style Javascript syntax differences between the old and a pure QuickJS environment, Cisco has put in place mechanisms to avoid existing macro deployments suddenly stop working. The Macros EvaluateTranspiled setting controls whether the macro engine will continue to support the old style \"require\" format for importing javascript libraries, e.g. const xapi = require(\"xapi\"). As older macros used to have this syntax, the Cisco devices have been graceful in allowing this, by using the Bable library to provide this backwards compatibility. For macros that are already using the more modern import syntax for libraries, e.g. import xapi from \"xapi\", Macros EvaluateTranspiled should be set to False. If you set Macros EvaluateTranspiled to False and Macros QuickJSEngine to On, and your macros are working as intended on the device, then your macro runtime environment is in the state all devices should be in going forward. We will enforce this behavior in a later release. Note that Macros EvaluateTranspiled is a temporary setting that will be removed once Cisco is content that all customers no longer have macros that are using the old Javascript style for importing libraries.",

In general, the minimum TLS (Transport Layer Security) version for the HTTPS connection is 1.1.

Note: The value is set to Off for a device that has been upgraded to CE9.9 (or later) from CE9.8 or earlier software versions, provided that the device has not been factory reset after the upgrade, and that the old NetworkServices HTTPS VerifyServerCertificate setting was not explicitly set to On.

As opposed to traditional reverberation time measurement where it is required to emit a noise or impulse signal in the room, the Cisco device will measure RT60 as a \"silent measurement\". Due to the silent measurement behavior, the RT60 values will be indicative and not strictly correct according to the ISO 3382-2 standard.

You cannot use the built-in serial port on Codec Pro and Room Panorama, or the micro-USB maintenance port on other devices for outbound control; these ports are reserved for inbound control. The communication between the device and peripheral is connectionless, meaning we don't establish a persistent serial port connection between them. The connection is first established when issuing the SerialPort PeripheralControl Send command, and the connection is dropped once the command is finished. These serial connection parameters are not configurable: Data bits (8), Stop bits (1), Flow control (None).

The device will not enter deep sleep mode if motion is detected, provided the Standby WakeupOnMotionDetection feature is enabled, which is the default setting. Additionally, the device will wake up once every night to check for software updates. If office hours are enabled, the device will also wake up at a randomized time between 20 to 40 minutes before the configured office hours start time.",

When the input connector is set up to support HDCP, the following restrictions apply: You can't share any content from this input while in a call. However, you can share both HDCP protected content and non-protected content locally. You can't take web snapshots of this source. To be able to show HDCP protected content on the device's screen, also ensure that the Video Output Connector [n] HDCPPolicy configuration is set correctly and that the screen itself supports HDCP.",

        "description": "Miracast allows meeting participants to share content wirelessly from their laptop (Windows or Android) to a video device, without the need for a client. Miracast uses either Wi-Fi Direct to establish a direct network connection from a sending device (typically a meeting participant's laptop) to the video device, or infrastructure, which means using the existing network infrastructure for both signaling (MS-MICE and RTSP) and media. You choose which method to use in the Video Input Miracast Transport setting. Both methods support only the 2.4 GHz band, and use TCP port 7236 for signaling (RTSP) when establishing the connection. In addition, when the connection is via infrastructure, the MS-MICE protocol uses TCP port 7250. For more information about the MS-MICE protocol, refer to Microsoft's documentation. When Miracast is turned on, the video device emits a beacon that near-by devices can pick up (range in the order of 100 meter). The broadcast name that appears in the near-by devices' scan lists depends on the configuration. To be sure not to include any PII (personal identifiable information), you can specifically set a broadcast name with the SystemUnit BroadcastName setting. Otherwise, the scan lists will include the Webex DisplayName if the device is registered to the Webex cloud service, and the SystemUnit Name if registered to an on-premises service. If neither of these names are set, the product type (id) will be displayed. When the connection is via infrastructure, the beacon also contains the video device's IP address and hostname. Because Miracast is using Wi-Fi, it is not supported by non-radio devices. Also, you must remember to connect the Wi-Fi antennas on those products where they are optional. Further, the device must be connected to the network with cable (and have an IP address on the wired network interface).",

The device then switches the input back so the device is the active video input source. If the device is not the active input source when the device goes into standby the screen will not be set to standby. It's a prerequisite that the screen that is connected to the output is CEC compatible and that CEC is enabled on the screen.

Likewise the device will wake up the screen when the device itself wakes up from standby. The active video input on a screen is sometimes changed by a user. When a call is started the device detects if the active video input has been switched to another input on the screen. The device then switches the input back so the device is the active video input source. If the device is not the active input source when the device goes into standby the screen will not be set to standby. It's a prerequisite that the screen that is connected to the output is CEC compatible and that CEC is enabled on the screen.

        "description": "This video output (HDMI) supports Consumer Electronics Control (CEC). When this setting is On, the video device will use CEC to set the screen in standby when the device itself enters standby. Likewise the device will wake up the screen when the device itself wakes up from standby. The active video input on a screen is sometimes changed by a user. When a call is started the device detects if the active video input has been switched to another input on the screen. The device then switches the input back so the device is the active video input source. If the device is not the active input source when the device goes into standby the screen will not be set to standby. It's a prerequisite that the screen that is connected to the output is CEC compatible and that CEC is enabled on the screen. Note that the different manufacturers uses different marketing names for CEC, for example Anynet+ (Samsung); Aquos Link (Sharp); BRAVIA Sync (Sony); HDMI-CEC (Hitachi); Kuro Link (Pioneer); CE-Link and Regza Link (Toshiba); RIHD (Onkyo); HDAVI Control, EZ-Sync, VIERA Link (Panasonic); EasyLink (Philips); and NetCommand for HDMI (Mitsubishi).",

They also need a presentation cable (HDMI) between the laptop and an HDMI input to make use of the device's screen and loudspeakers. This feature is referred to as Call from laptop, Webcam mode, or HDMI passthrough. Which HDMI output the HDMI-to-USB converter is connected to is set with the Video Output HDMI Passthrough OutputConnector setting. You may also want to check that the Video Monitors and Video Output Connector [n] MonitorRole settings are correct. Call from laptop is not supported on Room 55 Dual and Room 70 Dual because they don't have an HDMI output available for the converter.",
